based on the security of the TOE.
The TOE provides a variety of security features. The hardware of the Micro Controller already protects against
physical attacks by applying various sensors to detect manipulations and by processing data in ways which
protect against leakage of data by side channel analysis. With the software stack the TOE provides many
cryptographic primitives for encryption, decryption, signature generation, signature verification, key generation,
secure management of PINs and secure storage of confidential data (e.g. keys, PINs). Also the software stack
implements several countermeasures to protect the TOE against attacks.
The following list contains the features of this TOE:

     • Cryptographic algorithms and functionality:

            1. 3DES for en-/decryption (CBC and ECB) and MAC generation and verification (2-key 3DES, 3-key
               3DES, Retail-MAC, CMAC and CBC-MAC).
            2. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for en-/decryption (GCM, CBC and ECB) and MAC generation
               and verification (CMAC, CBC-MAC).
            3. RSA and RSA CRT for en-/decryption and signature generation and verification.
            4. RSA and RSA CRT key generation.
            5. SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 hash algorithm.
            6. Secure SHA-1, Secure SHA-224, Secure SHA-256, Secure SHA-384, Secure SHA-512 hash algorithm.
            7. HMAC
            8. ECC over GF(p) for signature generation and verification (ECDSA).
            9. ECC over GF(p) key generation for key agreement.
           10. Random number generation according to class DRG.3 of AIS 20 [15]
           11. Twisted Edwards Curve 25519 for signature generation and verification (EdDSA)
           12. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange on Montgomery Curve (25519)

     • Java Card 3.0.4 functionality:

            1. Executing Java Card bytecodes.
            2. Managing memory allocation of code and data of applets.

   1. The first group is the end-users group, which uses the TOE with one or more loaded applets in the final
      form factor as an embedded Secure Element. These users only require a communication device to be able
      to communicate with the TOE. The TOE communicates via the System Mail Box connected to the Integrated
           NFC controller of the SN100. This facilitates contactless or wired interfaces supporting:

              • Card Emulation Type A, Type B and Type F according to ETSI 102 622 [13].
              • Wired Mode by using the APDUCard Gate according to ETSI 102 622 [14].

           The wired interface is expected to be connected to an applications processor. JCOP 6.[ also supports an
           I2C interface to the eSE.

   2. The second group of users are administrators of cards. They can configure the TOE by using the Config
      Applet or install additional applets. These users require the same equipment as end-users.

   3. The third group of users develops Java Card applets and executes them on the TOE. These applet developers
      need in addition to the communication device a set of tools for the development of applets. This set of tools
      can be obtained from the TOE vendor and comprises elements such as PC development environment, byte
      code verifier, compiler, linker and debugger.

JCOP OS component. Table 1.10 in section 1.3.3 lists all possible values for the Platform ID that are valid for
this TOE.



1.3.1.3.1.1 Applet Migration Component

The new Applet Migration feature allows to perform an applet update while preserving the personalization data.
From a functional perspective there are two logical APDUs commands that trigger the Applet Migration process:

     • an export APDU command containing a migration plan which identifies uniquely the package and the applet
       instance to export data and the respective new applet instance to import it. This identification is based on
       the packages’ and applets’ AIDs. As per the migration plan the applets are triggered to export their data.
       The packages, applets and instances are then deleted.

     • an import APDU command instructing the new applet instances to import the previously exported data.

The authenticity of the Applet Migration APDUs is always guaranteed:

     • either by including a signature and chained hash, similar to the APDUs used for OS update.

     • or by sending the APDUs over a Secure Channel protocol established with the ISD.

The main components of the Applet Migration feature are:

     • a predefined Java interface MigratableApplet to be implemented by applets so that those are enabled for
       applet data migration. The JCRE notifies the applet for the import/export events via this interface.

     • the ArchiveManager which is responsible to handle migrated data. The ArchiveManager receives and
       handles the migration plan from the Export APDU and ensures that the exported data can be imported by an
       applet with an AID as specified in the migration plan. The ArchiveManager allows setting and personalizing
       the SSD hierarchy during import or export phases.

The underlying mechanism of Applet Migration has the following steps:

     • the off card entity sends an export APDU commands over SCP or with a valid signature and chained hashes.
       The export APDU command is handled by the ArchiveManager which triggers the data export according to
       the migration plan conveyed in the export APDUs. ArchiveManager triggers applets whose AIDs are in the
       migration plan to export their respective personalization data. The exported data is stored in a data structure
       called data store. The packages, Applets and instances are deleted and removed from the registry.

     • the off card entity sends an import APDU. The ArchiveManager triggers the new applet instances identified
       by their AID to import the previously exported data as specified in the migration plan.

Applet Migration may be combined with the OS update process. In this use case scenario applet export and
import phases take place respectively before and after the OS update.

1.3.1.3.1.2    IM4 Feature

The IM4 feature provides control over the Applet Migration and OS update processes. This control consists in
enforcing that

     • Applet Migration and OS update steps can be performed only in a particular state of the TOE.

     • only allowed OS update plans can be applied to the TOE.

No security claims are made for IM4. The use of IM4 does not compromise any of the security of the OS update
or the Applet Migration mechanisms and all restrictions implied by these mechanisms remain in force.
The IM4 implementation does not replace or modify the existing mechanisms by which the SE decrypts, authenticates
and authorizes JCOP updates. Rather, the purpose of IM4 is to facilitate a counter-signature scheme designed to
verify the customer authorization of the updates with minimum impact to the update implementation.


1.3.1.3.2     Native Applications

The Native Applications extend the available cryptographic algorithms for the Security Software. These Native
Applications are proprietary implementations (e.g. Felica) which make use of the Security Software’s security
mechanisms. Native Applications are provided to JCOP OS via the Security Software. No security functionality
claimed for Native Applications, it is an extension to the Crypto Lib.


1.3.1.3.3     OS Update Component

The OS Update Component can update JCOP OS and UpdaterOS and contains two main components:

     • OsSelector (no security claimed): After a hardware reset it provides the functionality to either boot UpdaterOS
       or JCOP OS. OsSelector also ensures that

           – only one OS is active (running) at a time.
           – at any time, at least one OS can be booted.
           – an invalid OS (e.g. partly flashed) can never be booted.

     • UpdaterOS:

           – it handles APDUs to write a new OS (either JCOP OS or UpdaterOS) to flash.
           – it verifies the integrity of the new OS before updating.
           – it decrypts the new OS before updating.
           – it checks if the new OS can be authenticated and checks if the update can be authorized.
           – it ensures that the activation and setting of the information that identifies the new OS is done atomically.
           – if the update fails the system stays in a secure state.

           The UpdaterOS is a standalone operating system that can only be active when JCOP OS is not active.
           Besides the capability to update JCOP OS, UpdaterOS is also capable to update itself. The UpdaterOS
           version can be queried by using a SELECT OS Update AID Command (see JCOP 5.0 UGM[34], JCOP
           6.0 UGM[37]-&238*0>@). UpdaterOS shares parts of the Native OS with JCOP OS, e.g.: 

The evaluation process is limited to phases 1 to 5. User Applet development is outside the scope of this evaluation.
Applets can be loaded into Flash memory. Applet loading into Flash memory can be done in phases 3, 4, 5, and
6. Applet loading in phase 7 is also allowed. This means post-issuance loading of applets can be done for a
certified TOE. The certification is only valid for platforms that return the Platform Identifier as stated in Table
1.10. The delivery process from NXP to their customers (to phase 4 or phase 5 of the life cycle) guarantees,
that the customer is aware of the exact versions of the different parts of the TOE as outlined above. TOE
documentation is delivered in electronic form (encrypted according to defined mailing procedures).
Note: Phases 1 to 3 are under the TOE developer scope of control. Therefore, the objectives for the environment
related to phase 1 to 3 are covered by Assurance measures, which are materialized by documents, process and
procedures evaluated through the TOE evaluation process. During phases 4 to 7 the TOE is no more under the

usage recommendation must also be followed in order to ensure that the TOE is correctly and securely handled,
and that shall be not damaged or comprised. This ST assumes (A.USE_DIAG, A.USE_KEYS) that users handle
securely the TOE and related Objectives for the environment are defined (OE.USE_DIAG, OE.USE_KEYS).

Additionally to the Platform Identifier the TOE can also be identified by its sequence number:

   1. If UpdaterOS is active then the "SELECT OS Update AID" command will return the Current Sequence
      Number of UpdaterOS and the Reference Sequence Number.

   2. If JCOP OS is active then the "Get OS Info" command will return the Current Sequence Number of JCOP
      OS (Final Sequence Number).

1.3.3.1 IC Identifier
The Version Query command, available on JCOP 6.x only, is described in [37] and [40] and can be used to
retrieve the identifier of the different components of the underlying SE software and hardware. The Version
Query Command is a proprietary GET DATA command with tag 0xDF4C. Before sending the command to JCOP
the ISD or CASD shall be selected. The Data returned by the Version Query includes the Tag for Hardware ID
(tag 0x 8C), which is 2 bytes long.

The MSB of the Hardware ID is the Hardware specific byte tied to the IP block (0x08). The LSB is read from the
Systems page and identifies the Hardware plus ROM contents (0x0C = SN100 B2.1).

1.3.4 Evaluated Package Types
The only available package type is "Wafer Level Chip Scale Package" (WLCSP). This package is a thin fine-pitch
ball grid array package. All (enabled) pins of the TOE are externally accessible. Any additional security provided
by the plastic package is ignored for the security of the TOE and therefore the package type is not security relevant.

2          Conformance Claims (ASE_CCL)
This chapter is divided into the following sections: "CC Conformance Claim", "Package Claim", "PP Claim", and
"Conformance Claim Rationale".


2.1        CC Conformance Claim
This Security Target claims to be conformant to version 3.1 of Common Criteria for Information Technology
Security Evaluation according to

     • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 1, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April
       2017" [8]

     • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 2, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April
       2017" [9]

     • "Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Part 3, Version 3.1, Revision 5, April
       2017" [10]

The following methodology will be used for the evaluation:

     • Common Methodology for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Evaluation Methodology, Version
       3.1, Revision 5" [11]

This Security Target claims to be CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant. The extended Security
Functional Requirements are defined in Chapter 6.


2.2        Package Claim
This Security Target claims conformance to the assurance package EAL5 augmented. The augmentation to
EAL5 is AVA_VAN.5 “Advanced methodical vulnerability analysis”, ALC_DVS.2 “Sufficiency of security measures”,
ASE_TSS.2 “TOE summary specification with architectural design summary”, and ALC_FLR.1 “Basic flaw remediation”.


2.3        PP Claim
The Security Target claims demonstrable conformance to the Java Card Protection Profile - Open Configuration,
Version 3.0.5 (Dec 2017), (BSI-CC-PP-0099-2017) [3]. The TOE does not support Java Card RMI nor "Extended
Memory (EXT-MEM)". This ST is more restrictive than the PP [3] which chapter 2.4 provides a rationale for.

2.4        Conformance Claim Rationale
2.4.1      TOE Type
The TOE type as stated in Section 1.2 of this ST corresponds to the TOE type of the PP as stated in Section 1.2
of [3] namely a Java Card platform, implementing the Java Card Specification Version 3.0.4 [6, 5, 4].
This Security Target claims conformance to the following packages of security requirements out of those for
Cryptographic Services defined in the Smartcard IC Platform Protection profile [12].

     • Package "TDES"

     • Package "AES"

2.4.2      SPD Statement
The SPD statement that is presented in Chapter 4 includes the threats as presented in the PP [3], but also includes
additional threats. These threats are:

     • T.RND

     • T.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD

     • T.INTEG-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD

     • T.UNAUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE

     • T.INTERRUPT-OSU

     • T.CONFIG

     • T.COM_EXPLOIT

     • T.LIFE_CYCLE

     • T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT

     • T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED]

     • T.ATTACK-COUNTER

     • T.AM_DATASTORE_ACCESS

The threat T.RND is taken from the Security IC PP [12].
The threats T.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD, T.INTEG-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD, T.UNAUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE
and T.INTERRUPT-OSU are included for the OS Update which is additional functionality the PP allows.
The threat T.CONFIG is an additional threat to cover unauthorized modifications and read access of the configuration
area in the TOE. It is an addition to the threats defined in the PP [3]. The threat T.ATTACK-COUNTER is included

for the Restricted Mode which is additional functionality the PP allows. The threat T.COM_EXPLOIT is included
to cover communication channels attacks and it is an addition to the threats in the PP [3].
The threat T.LIFE_CYCLE is included to cover content management attacks and it is an addition to the threats in
the PP [3].
The threat T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT refines the threats T.INSTALL and T.DELETION from the PP [3].
The threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA[REFINED] refines the threat T.INTEG-APPLI-DATA in the PP [3].
The threat T.AM_DATASTORE_ACCESS is included for Applet Migration which is additional functionality the PP
allows. Note that the threat T.EXE-CODE-REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not support Java Card
RMI. The Java Card Protection Profile [3] makes the use of Java Card RMI optional.
The SPD statement presented in Chapter 4, copies the OSP from the PP [3], and adds the following additional
OSPs:

     • OSP.PROCESS-TOE

     • OSP.KEY-CHANGE

     • OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS

The OSP OSP.PROCESS-TOE is introduced for the pre-personalisation feature of the TOE and is an addition to
the OSPs in PP [3]. The OSP OSP.KEY-CHANGE is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is an addition
to the OSPs in PP [3]. The OSP OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS is introduced for the SD feature of the TOE and is an
addition to the OSPs in PP [3].
The SPD statement includes two of the three assumptions from the PP [3]. The assumption A.Deletion is
excluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore the assumption is no longer relevant. Leaving
out the assumption, makes the SPD of this ST more restrictive than the SPD in the PP [3]. As the Card Manager
is part of the TOE, it is ensuring that the deletion of applets through the Card Manager is secure, instead of
assuming that it is handled by the Card Manager in the environment of the TOE.
Besides the assumptions from the PP [3], five additional assumptions are added:

     • A.PROCESS-SEC-IC

     • A.USE_DIAG

     • A.USE_KEYS

     • A.APPS-PROVIDER

     • A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY

The assumption A.PROCESS-SEC-IC is taken from the underlying certified Micro Controller [], which is compliant
to the Security IC PP [12].
The assumptions A.USE_DIAG and A.USE_KEYS are included because the Card Manager is part of the TOE
and no longer part of the environment.

The assumptions A.APPS-PROVIDER and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are added because Security Domains
from the GlobalPlatform Specification are introduced. All the applets and packages are signed by the APSD and
the correctness is verified on the TOE by VASD before the package or applet is installed or loaded. A.APPS-PROVIDER
and A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY are additions to PP [3] for card content management environment.

2.4.3      Security Objectives Statement
The statement of security objectives in the ST presented in Chapter 5 includes all security objectives as presented
in the PP [3], but also includes a number of additional security objectives. These security objectives are:

     • OT.IDENTIFICATION

     • OT.RND

     • OT.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD

     • OT.AUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE

     • OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE

     • OT.SECURE_AC_ACTIVATION

     • OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION

     • OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION

     • OT.ATTACK-COUNTER

     • OT.RESTRICTED-MODE

     • OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS

     • OT.APPLI-AUTH

     • OT.COMM_AUTH

     • OT.COMM_INTEGRITY

     • OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY

     • OT.DATASTORE_ACCESS

The security objectives OT.IDENTIFICATION, OT.RND are part of the security objectives of the certified Micro
Controller [] (see also Section 1.3.1.1) and Security Software [] (see also Section 1.3.1.2.2), which are
alsocomponents of this composite certification. Therefore the security objective statement is equivalent to the
PP [3] for these two security objectives. OT.IDENTIFICATION is also included for the pre-personalisation
feature of theTOE, which is additional functionality the PP allows.

The security objective OT.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD, OT.AUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE,
OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE, OT.SECURE_AC_ACTIVATION, OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION are included for the
OS Update which is additional functionality the PP allows.
The security objectives OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION is included for the Config Applet which is additional
functionality the PP allows.
The security objectives OT.ATTACK-COUNTER and OT.RESTRICTED-MODE are included for the restricted mode
which is additional functionality the PP allows.
The security objectives OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS, OT.APPLI-AUTH, OT.COMM_AUTH, OT.COMM_INTEGRITY,
OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY are objectives for the TOE as the GlobalPlatform API and the definitions for
Secure Channel, Security Domains and Card Content Management are used from it.
The ST contains OE.APPLET, OE.VERIFICATION and OE.CODE-EVIDENCE from Security Objectives for the
Operational Environment from [3]. Additionally, some of the Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
from [3] are listed as TOE Security Objectives in this ST:
     • OT.SCP.RECOVERY instead of OE.SCP.RECOVERY

     • OT.SCP.SUPPORT instead of OE.SCP.SUPPORT

     • OT.SCP.IC instead of OE.SCP.IC

     • OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT instead of OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT

OT.SCP.RECOVERY, OT.SCP.SUPPORT, and OT.SCP.IC are objectives for the TOE as the Smart Card Platform
belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT is an objective for the TOE as the Card
Manager belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. Moving objectives from the environment to the TOE, adds
objectives to the TOE without changing the overall objectives. The statement of security objectives is therefore
equivalent to the security objectives in the PP [3] to which conformance is claimed. The security objective
OT.DATASTORE_ACCESS addresses the need for access control policy to be enforced for the Applet Migration
feature.
The security objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from the PP [3] are not included since these
functionality and objectives are covered by the refined OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT.
Note that the objective O.REMOTE is not included, since the TOE does not support Java Card RMI. The Java
Card Protection Profile makes the use of Java Card RMI optional.
Note that the objective O.EXT-MEM is not included, since the TOE does not support "Extended Memory (EXT-MEM)".
The Java Card Protection Profile makes the use of "Extended Memory (EXT-MEM)" optional.
A part of the security objectives for the environment defined in the PP [3] has been included in this ST. The other
part of security objectives for the environment, which is present in the PP [3], is used as part of the security
objectives for the TOE in this ST. The ST also introduces eight additional security objectives for the environment.
The additional objectives for the environment are:
     • OE.USE_DIAG

     • OE.USE_KEYS

     • OE.APPS-PROVIDER

     • OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY

     • OE.KEY-CHANGE

     • OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS

The security objective for the environment OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC is from the hardware platform (Micro Controller
[], see also Section 1.3.1.1) that is part of this composite product evaluation. Therefore the statement of security
objectives for the environment is equivalent to the statement in the Security IC PP [12].
OE.USE_KEYS and OE.USE_DIAG are included because the Card Manager is part of the TOE and not a security
objective for the environment as in PP [3].
The security objective for the environment OE.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.CREATE is to cover the confidentiality
during creation and transmission phase of D.UPDATE_IMAGE and therefore partly covers the threats introduced
by the update mechanism which is additional functionality.
OE.APPS-PROVIDER and OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY cover trusted actors which enable the creation,
distributionand verification of secure applications. OE.KEY-CHANGE covers the switch to trusted keys for the AP.
OE.SECURITY-DOMAINS covers the management of security domains in the context of the GlobalPlatform
Specification.
The statement of security objectives for the environment is therefore considered to be equivalent to the security
objectives in the PP [3] to which conformance is claimed.

2.4.4      Security Functional Requirements Statement
The Security Functional Requirements Statement copies most SFRs as defined in the PP [3], with the exception
of a number of options. For the copied set of SFRs the ST is considered equivalent to the statement of SFRs
in the PP [3]. Moreover as requested by the PP [3] the ST adds additional threats, objectives and SFRs to fully
cover and describe additional security functionality implemented in the TOE.
The TOE restricts remote access from the CAD to the services implemented by the applets on the card to
none, and as a result the SFRs concerning Java Card RMI (FDP_ACF.1[JCRMI], SFRs FDP_IFC.1/JCRMI,
FDP_IFF.1/JCRMI, FMT_MSA.1/EXPORT, FMT_MSA.1/REM_REFS, FMT_MSA.3/JCRMI, FMT_SMF.1/JCRMI,
FMT_REV.1/JCRMI, and FMT_SMR.1/JCRMI) are not included in the ST. In the PP [3] the use of the Java Card
RMI is optional. The TOE does not implement Java Card RMI.
The TOE does not allow external memory access to the services implemented by the applets on the card,
and as a result the SFRs concerning "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)" (FDP_ACC.1/EXT_MEM,
FDP_ACF.1/EXT_MEM, FMT_MSA.1/EXT_MEM, FMT_MSA.3/EXT_MEM and FMT_SMF.1/EXT_MEM) are not
included in the ST. In the PP [3] the use of the "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)" is optional. The
TOE does not implement "Management of External Memory (EXT-MEM)".

The SFR FDP_ITC.2/INSTALLER from the PP [3] is replaced by FDP_ITC.2[CCM] which enforces the Firewall
access control policy and the Secure Channel Protocol information flow policy and which is more restrictive than
the PACKAGE LOADING information flow control SFP from PP [3].
The set of SFRs that define the card content management mechanism CarG are partly replaced or refined and
are considered to be equivalent or more restrictive because of the newly introduced SFPs:

   1. Security Domain access control policy

   2. Secure Channel Protocol information flow policy

These SFPs provide a concrete and more restrictive implementation of the PACKAGE LOADING information flow
control SFP from PP [3] by following the information flow policy defined by Global Platform specifications.

3          Security Aspects
This chapter describes the main security issues of the Java Card System and its environment addressed in
this ST, called "security aspects", in a CC-independent way. In addition to this, the security aspects also give
a semi-formal framework to express the CC security environment and objectives of the TOE. They can be
instantiated as assumptions, threats, objectives (for the TOE and the environment) or organizational security
policies. The description is based on [3].


3.1        Confidentiality
SA.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE              Confidentiality of Update Image
                                    The update image must be kept confidential. This concerns the non disclosure of
                                    the update image in transit to the card.

SA.CONFID-APPLI-DATA                Confidentiality of Application Data
                                    Application data must be protected against unauthorized disclosure. This concerns
                                    logical attacks at runtime in order to gain read access to other application’s data.

SA.CONFID-JCS-CODE                  Confidentiality of Java Card System Code
                                    Java Card System code must be protected against unauthorized disclosure. Knowledge
                                    of the Java Card System code may allow bypassing the TSF. This concerns logical
                                    attacks at runtime in order to gain a read access to executable code, typically by
                                    executing an application that tries to read the memory area where a piece of Java
                                    Card System code is stored.

SA.CONFID-JCS-DATA                  Confidentiality of Java Card System Data
                                    Java Card System data must be protected against unauthorized disclosure. This
                                    concerns logical attacks at runtime in order to gain a read access to Java Card
                                    System data. Java Card System data includes the data managed by the Java Card
                                    RE, the Java Card VM and the internal data of Java Card platform API classes as
                                    well.


3.2        Integrity
SA.INTEG-UPDATE-IMAGE               Integrity of Update Image
                                    The update image must be protected against unauthorized modification. This
                                    concerns the modification of the image in transit to the card.

SA.INTEG-APPLI-CODE                 Integrity of Application Code
                                    Application code must be protected against unauthorized modification. This concerns
                                    logical attacks at runtime in order to gain write access to the memory zone where
                                    executable code is stored. In post-issuance application loading, this threat also
                                    concerns the modification of application code in transit to the card.

SA.INTEG-APPLI-DATA         Integrity of Application Data
                            Application data must be protected against unauthorized modification. This concerns
                            logical attacks at runtime in order to gain unauthorized write access to application
                            data. In post-issuance application loading, this threat also concerns the modification
                            of application data contained in a package in transit to the card. For instance,
                            a package contains the values to be used for initializing the static fields of the
                            package.

SA.INTEG-JCS-CODE           Integrity of Java Card System Code
                            Java Card System code must be protected against unauthorized modification.
                            This concerns logical attacks at runtime in order to gain write access to executable
                            code.

SA.INTEG-JCS-DATA           Integrity of Java Card System Data
                            Java Card System data must be protected against unauthorized modification. This
                            concerns logical attacks at runtime in order to gain write access to Java Card

3.3        Unauthorized Executions
SA.EXE-APPLI-CODE           Execution of Application Code
                            Application (byte)code must be protected against unauthorized execution. This
                            concerns:

                              1. invoking a method outside the scope of the accessibility rules provided by
                                    the access modifiers of the Java programming language ([28])
                              2. jumping inside a method fragment or interpreting the contents of a data
                                    memory area as if it was executable code
                              3. unauthorized execution of a remote method from the CAD (if the TOE provides
                                    JCRMI functionality).

SA.EXE-JCS-CODE             Execution of Java Card System Code
                            Java Card System bytecode must be protected against unauthorized execution.
                            Java Card System bytecode includes any code of the Java Card RE or API. This
                            concerns:

                              1. invoking a method outside the scope of the accessibility rules provided by

SA.FIREWALL                                     Firewall
                                                The Firewall shall ensure controlled sharing of class instances1 , and isolation of
                                                their data and code between packages (that is, controlled execution contexts)
                                                as well as between packages and the JCRE context. An applet shall not read,
                                                write, compare a piece of data belonging to an applet that is not in the same
                                                context, or execute one of the methods of an applet in another context without its
                                                authorization.

SA.NATIVE                                       Native Code Execution
                                                Because the execution of native code is outside of the JCS TSF scope, it must
                                                be secured so as to not provide ways to bypass the TSFs of the JCS. Loading
                                                of native code, which is as well outside those TSFs, is submitted to the same
                                                requirements. Should native software be privileged in this respect, exceptions to
                                                the policies must include a rationale for the new security framework they introduce.


3.4          Bytecode Verification
SA.VERIFICATION                                 Bytecode Verification
                                                Bytecode must be verified prior to being executed. Bytecode verification includes:

                                                   1. how well-formed CAP file is and the verification of the typing constraints on
                                                      the bytecode,
                                                   2. binary compatibility with installed CAP files and the assurance that the export
                                                      files used to check the CAP file correspond to those that will be present on
                                                      the card when loading occurs.


3.5          Card Management
SA.CARD-MANAGEMENT                              Card Management


                                                   1. The card manager (CM) shall control the access to card management functions
                                                      such as the installation, update or deletion of applets.
                                                   2. The card manager shall implement the card issuer’s policy on the card.

SA.INSTALL                                      Installation


                                                   1. The TOE must be able to return to a safe and consistent state when the
                                                      installation of a package or an applet fails or be cancelled (whatever the

                              2. Installing an applet must have no effect on the code and data of already
                                 installed applets. The installation procedure should not be used to bypass
                                 the TSFs. In short, it is an atomic operation, free of harmful effects on the
                                 state of the other applets.
                              3. The procedure of loading and installing a package shall ensure its integrity
                                 and authenticity.

SA.SID                      Subject Identification


                              1. Users and subjects of the TOE must be identified.
                              2. The identity of sensitive users and subjects associated with administrative
                                 and privileged roles must be particularly protected; this concerns the Java
                                 Card RE, the applets registered on the card, and especially the default applet
                                 and the currently selected applet (and all other active applets in Java Card
                                 System). A change of identity, especially standing for an administrative role
                                 (like an applet impersonating the Java Card RE), is a severe violation of the
                                 SFR. Selection controls the access to any data exchange between the TOE
                                 and the CAD and therefore, must be protected as well. The loading of a
                                 package or any exchange of data through the APDU buffer (which can be
                                 accessed by any applet) can lead to disclosure of keys, application code or
                                 data, and so on.

SA.OBJ-DELETION             Object Deletion


                              1. Deallocation of objects should not introduce security holes in the form of
                                 references pointing to memory zones that are not longer in use, or have
                                 been reused for other purposes. Deletion of collection of objects should not
                                 be maliciously used to circumvent the TSFs.
                              2. Erasure, if deemed successful, shall ensure that the deleted class instance
                                 is no longer accessible.

SA.DELETION                 Deletion


                              1. Deletion of installed applets (or packages) should not introduce security
                                 holes in the form of broken references to garbage collected code or data,
                                 nor should they alter integrity or confidentiality of remaining applets. The
                                 deletion procedure should not be maliciously used to bypass the TSFs.
                              2. Erasure, if deemed successful, shall ensure that any data owned by the
                                 deleted applet is no longer accessible (shared objects shall either prevent
                                 deletion or be made inaccessible). A deleted applet cannot be selected or

                                 receive APDU commands. Package deletion shall make the code of the
                                 package no longer available for execution.
                              3. Power failure or other failures during the process shall be taken into account
                                 in the implementation so as to preserve the SFRs. This does not mandate,
                                 however, the process to be atomic. For instance, an interrupted deletion may
                                 result in the loss of user data, as long as it does not violate the SFRs.
                            The deletion procedure and its characteristics (whether deletion is either physical
                            or logical, what happens if the deleted application was the default applet, the order
                            to be observed on the deletion steps) are implementation-dependent. The only
                            commitment is that deletion shall not jeopardize the TOE (or its assets) in case of
                            failure (such as power shortage).
                            Deletion of a single applet instance and deletion of a whole package are functionally
                            different operations and may obey different security rules. For instance, specific
                            packages can be declared to be undeletable (for instance, the Java Card API
                            packages), or the dependency between installed packages may forbid the deletion
                            (like a package using super classes or super interfaces declared in another package).


3.6        Services
SA.ALARM                    Alarm
                            The TOE shall provide appropriate feedback upon detection of a potential security
                            violation. This particularly concerns the type errors detected by the bytecode
                            verifier, the security exceptions thrown by the Java Card VM, or any other security-
                            related event occurring during the execution of a TSF.

SA.OPERATE                  Operate


                              1. The TOE must ensure continued correct operation of its security functions.
                              2. In case of failure during its operation, the TOE must also return to a well-defined
                                 valid state before the next service request.

SA.RESOURCES                Resources
                            The TOE controls the availability of resources for the applications and enforces
                            quotas and limitations in order to prevent unauthorized denial of service or malfunction
                            of the TSFs. This concerns both execution (dynamic memory allocation) and
                            installation (static memory allocation) of applications and packages.

SA.CIPHER                   Cipher
                            The TOE shall provide a means to the applications for ciphering sensitive data, for
                            instance, through a programming interface to low-level, highly secure cryptographic
                            services. In particular, those services must support cryptographic algorithms
                            consistent with cryptographic usage policies and standards.

SA.KEY-MNGT                 Key Management
                            The TOE shall provide means to securely manage cryptographic keys. This
                            includes:

                              1. Keys shall be generated in accordance with specified cryptographic key
                                 generation algorithms and specified cryptographic key sizes,
                              2. Keys must be distributed in accordance with specified cryptographic key
                                 distribution methods,
                              3. Keys must be initialized before being used,
                              4. Keys shall be destroyed in accordance with specified cryptographic key destruction
                                 methods.

SA.PIN-MNGT                 PIN Management
                            The TOE shall provide means to securely manage PIN objects. This includes:

                              1. Atomic update of PIN value and try counter,
                              2. No rollback on the PIN-checking function,
                              3. Keeping the PIN value (once initialized) secret (for instance, no clear-PIN-reading
                                 function),
                              4. Enhanced protection of PIN’s security attributes (state, try counter ...) in
                                 confidentiality and integrity.

SA.SCP                      Smart Card Platform
                            The smart card platform must be secure with respect to the SFRs. Then:

                              1. After a power loss, RF signal loss or sudden card removal prior to completion
                                 of some communication protocol, the SCP will allow the TOE on the next
                                 power up to either complete the interrupted operation or revert to a secure
                                 state.
                              2. It does not allow the SFRs to be bypassed or altered and does not allow
                                 access to other low-level functions than those made available by the packages
                                 of the Java Card API. That includes the protection of its private data and code
                                 (against disclosure or modification) from the Java Card System.
                              3. It provides secure low-level cryptographic processing to the Java Card System.
                              4. It supports the needs for any update to a single persistent object or class
                                 field to be atomic, and possibly a low-level transaction mechanism.
                              5. It allows the Java Card System to store data in a ”persistent technology
                                 memory” or in volatile memory, depending on its needs (for instance, transient
                                 objects must not be stored in non-volatile memory). The memory model
                                 is structured and allows for low-level control accesses (segmentation fault
                                 detection).

                                 6. It safely transmits low-level exceptions to the TOE (arithmetic exceptions,
                                    checksum errors), when applicable.
                                 7. Finally, it is required that the IC is designed in accordance with a well-defined
                                    set of policies and standards (for instance, those specified in [12]), and
                                    will be tamper resistant to actually prevent an attacker from extracting or
                                    altering security data (like cryptographic keys) by using commonly employed
                                    techniques (physical probing and sophisticated analysis of the chip). This
                                    especially matters to the management (storage and operation) of cryptographic
                                    keys.

SA.TRANSACTION                 Transaction
                               The TOE must provide a means to execute a set of operations atomically. This
                               mechanism must not jeopardise the execution of the user applications. The transaction
                               status at the beginning of an applet session must be closed (no pending updates).


3.7        Config Applet
SA.CONFIG-APPLET               Config Applet
                               The Config Applet is a JCOP functionality which allows to:

                                 1. Read and modify configuration items in the configuration area of the TOE,
                                 2. Disable Access to configuration item.


3.8        OS Update
SA.OSU                         OS Update
                               The UpdaterOS allows to update JCOP OS and the UpdaterOS itself. It ensures
                               that only valid updates can be installed on the TOE.


3.9        Restricted Mode
SA.RM                          Restricted Mode
                               If the Attack Counter reaches its limit the TOE goes into Restricted Mode. In this
                               mode it is possible to perform a limited set of functions, like authenticate against
                               the ISD, reset the Attack Counter or read logging information.


3.10        Applet Migration
SA.APPLET-MIGR                 Applet Migration
                               In case an applet gets updated it can keep its User Data: Keys, PIN and byte
                               arrays. The data is exported by the applet instances to be updated in a datastore
                               and is imported by the new applet instance.

intended with respect to un-trusted people or software, as various parties are involved during the first stages of
the smart card product life-cycle. Details concerning the threats are given in Section 4.2 hereafter.
Assets have to be protected, some in terms of confidentiality and some in terms of integrity or both integrity and
confidentiality. These assets might get compromised by the threats that the TOE is exposed to.
The assets to be protected by the TOE are listed below. They are grouped according to whether it is data created
by and for the user (User data) or data created by and for the TOE (TSF data). This definition of grouping is taken
from Section 5.1 of [3].

                               Directly threatened asset(s): D.ISD_KEYS, D.APSD_KEYS, D.APP_C_DATA,
                               D.APP_I_DATA, D.APP_CODE, D.SEC_DATA, and D.CARD_MNGT_DATA (any
                               other asset may be jeopardized should this attack succeed, depending on the
                               virulence of the installed application).
                               This security objective is a refinement of the Threats T.INSTALL and T.DELETION

T.COM_EXPLOIT               Communication Channel Remote Exploit
                            An attacker remotely exploits the communication channels established between a
                            third party and the TOE in order to modify or disclose confidential data.
                            All assets are threatened.

T.LIFE_CYCLE                Life Cycle
                            An attacker accesses to an application outside of its expected availability range
                            thus violating irreversible life cycle phases of the application (for instance, an
                            attacker repersonalizes the application). Directly threatened asset(s): D.APP_I_DATA,
                            D.APP_C_DATA, and D.CARD_MNGT_DATA.


4.2.7      Services
T.OBJ-DELETION              Object Deletion
                            The attacker keeps a reference to a garbage collected object in order to force the
                            TOE to execute an unavailable method, to make it to crash, or to gain access
                            to a memory containing data that is now being used by another application. See
                            SA.OBJ-DELETION for further details. Directly threatened asset(s): D.APP_C_DATA,
                            D.APP_I_DATA and D.APP_KEYS.


4.2.8      Miscellaneous
T.PHYSICAL                  Physical Tampering
                            The attacker discloses or modifies the design of the TOE, its sensitive data or
                            application code by physical (opposed to logical) tampering means. This threat
                            includes IC failure analysis, electrical probing, unexpected tearing, and DPA. That
                            also includes the modification of the runtime execution of Java Card System or
                            SCP software through alteration of the intended execution order of (set of) instructions
                            through physical tampering techniques. This threatens all the identified assets.
                            This threat refers to the point (7) of the security aspect SA.SCP, and all aspects
                            related to confidentiality and integrity of code and data.


4.2.9      Random Numbers
T.RND                       Deficiency of Random Numbers
                            An attacker may predict or obtain information about random numbers generated
                            by the TOE for instance because of a lack of entropy of the random numbers
                            provided. An attacker may gather information about the produced random numbers
                            which might be a problem because they may be used for instance to generate
                            cryptographic keys. Here the attacker is expected to take advantage of statistical
                            properties of the random numbers generated by the TOE without specific knowledge
                            about the TOE’s generator. Malfunctions or premature ageing are also considered
                            which may assist in getting information about random numbers.

                              activation of additional code) leaving the TOE in a partially functional state . Directly
                              threatened asset(s): D.JCS_CODE, D.JCS_DATA, D.UPDATE_IMAGE, D.TOE_IDENTIFIER.

4.3        Organisational Security Policies
OSP.VERIFICATION                 File Verification
                                 This policy shall ensure the consistency between the export files used in the
                                 verification and those used for installing the verified file. The policy must also
                                 ensure that no modification of the file is performed in between its verification and
                                 the signing by the verification authority. See SA.VERIFICATION for details.
                                 If the application development guidance provided by the platform developer contains
                                 recommandations related to the isolation property of the platform, this policy shall
                                 also ensure that the verification authority checks that these recommandations are
                                 applied in the application code

OSP.PROCESS-TOE                  Identification of the TOE
                                 An accurate identification must be established for the TOE. This requires that each
                                 instantiation of the TOE carries this identification.

OSP.KEY-CHANGE                   Security Domain Keys Change
                                 The AP shall change its initial security domain keys (APSD) before any operation
                                 on its Security Domain.

OSP.SECURITY-DOMAINS             Security Domains
                                 Security domains can be dynamically created, deleted and blocked during usage
                                 phase in post-issuance mode.


4.4        Assumptions
Note that the assumption A.DELETION is excluded. The Card Manager is part of the TOE and therefore the
assumption is no longer relevant.
A.APPLET                         Applets without Native Methods
                                 Applets loaded post-issuance do not contain native methods. The Java Card
                                 specification explicitly ”does not include support for native methods” ([6]) outside
                                 the API.

A.VERIFICATION                   Bytecode Verification
                                 All the bytecodes are verified at least once, before the loading, before the installation
                                 or before the execution, depending on the card capabilities, in order to ensure that
                                 each bytecode is valid at execution time.

A.USE_DIAG                       Usage of TOE’s Secure Communication Protocol by OE
                                 It is assumed that the operational environment supports and uses the secure
                                 communication protocols offered by the TOE.

A.USE_KEYS                  Protected Storage of Keys Outside of TOE
                            It is assumed that the keys which are stored outside the TOE and which are used
                            for secure communication and authentication between Smart Card and terminals
                            are protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own storage environment.
                            This is especially true for D.APSD_KEYS, D.ISD_KEYS, and D.VASD_KEYS.
                            Info: This is to assume that the keys used in terminals or systems are correctly
                            protected for confidentiality and integrity in their own environment, as the disclosure
                            of such information which is shared with the TOE but is not under the TOE control,
                            may compromise the security of the TOE.

A.PROCESS-SEC-IC            Protection during Packaging, Finishing and Personalisation
                            It is assumed that security procedures are used after delivery of the TOE by the
                            TOE Manufacturer up to delivery to the end consumer to maintain confidentiality
                            and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and test data (to prevent any
                            possible copy, modification, retention, theft or unauthorised use). This means
                            that the Phases after TOE Delivery are assumed to be protected appropriately.
                            The assets to be protected are: The information and material produced and/or
                            processed by the Security IC Embedded Software Developer in Phase 1 and by
                            the Composite Product Manufacturer can be grouped as follows:

                              1. the Security IC Embedded Software including specifications, implementation
                                 and related documentation,
                              2. pre-personalisation and personalisation data including specifications of formats
                                 and memory areas, test related data,
                              3. the User Data and related documentation, and
                              4. material for software development support

                            as long as they are not under the control of the TOE Manufacturer.

A.APPS-PROVIDER             Application Provider
                            The AP is a trusted actor that provides basic or secure applications. He is responsible
                            for his security domain keys (D.APSD_KEYS).
                            Info: An AP generally refers to the entity that issues the application. For instance it
                            can be a financial institution for a payment application such as EMV or a transport
                            operator for a transport application.

A.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY    Verification Authority
                            The VA is a trusted actor who is able to verify bytecode of an application loaded on
                            the card, guarantee and generate the digital signature attached to an application
                            and ensure that its public key for verifying the application signature is on the TOE.
                            Info: As a consequence, it guarantees the success of the application validation
                            upon loading.

OT.FIREWALL                  Firewall
                             The TOE shall ensure controlled sharing of data containers owned by applets of
                             different packages or the JCRE and between applets and the TSFs. See SA.FIREWALL
                             for details.

OT.GLOBAL_ARRAYS_CONFID      Confidentiality of Global Arrays
                             The TOE shall ensure that the APDU buffer that is shared by all applications is always
                             cleaned upon applet selection. The TOE shall ensure that the global byte array used
                             for the invocation of the install method of the selected applet is always cleaned after
                             the return from the install method.

OT.GLOBAL_ARRAYS_INTEG       Integrity of Global Arrays
                             The TOE shall ensure that only the currently selected applications may have a write
                             access to the APDU buffer and the global byte array used for the invocation of the
                             install method of the selected applet.

OT.NATIVE                    Native Code
                             The only means that the Java Card VM shall provide for an application to execute
                             native code is the invocation of a method of the Java Card API, or any additional API.
                             See SA.NATIVE for details.

OT.OPERATE                   Correct Operation
                             The TOE must ensure continued correct operation of its security functions. See
                             SA.OPERATE for details.

OT.REALLOCATION              Secure Re-Allocation
                             The TOE shall ensure that the re-allocation of a memory block for the runtime areas
                             of the Java Card VM does not disclose any information that was previously stored in
                             that block.

OT.RESOURCES                 Resources availability
                             The TOE shall control the availability of resources for the applications. See

5.1.3      Services
OT.ALARM                     Alarm
                             The TOE shall provide appropriate feedback information upon detection of a potential
                             security violation. See SA.ALARM for details.

OT.CIPHER                    Cipher
                             The TOE shall provide a means to cipher sensitive data for applications in a secure
                             way. In particular, the TOE must support cryptographic algorithms consistent with
                             cryptographic usage policies and standards. See SA.CIPHER for details.

OT.KEY-MNGT                  Key Management
                             The TOE shall provide a means to securely manage cryptographic keys. This concerns
                             the correct generation, distribution, access and destruction of cryptographic keys.
                             See SA.KEY-MNGT.

OT.PIN-MNGT                  Pin Management
                             The TOE shall provide a means to securely manage PIN objects. See SA.PIN-MNGT
                             for details.
                             AppNote: PIN objects may play key roles in the security architecture of client applications.
                             The way they are stored and managed in the memory of the smart card must be
                             carefully considered, and this applies to the whole object rather than the sole value of
                             the PIN.

OT.TRANSACTION               Transaction
                             The TOE must provide a means to execute a set of operations atomically. See
                             SA.TRANSACTION for details.


5.1.4      Object Deletion
OT.OBJ-DELETION              Object Deletion
                             The TOE shall ensure the object deletion shall not break references to objects. See
                             SA.OBJ-DELETION for further details.


5.1.5      Applet Management
OT.APPLI-AUTH                Application Authentication
                             The card manager shall enforce the application security policies established by the
                             card issuer by requiring application authentication during application loading on the
                             card. This security objective is a refinement of the Security Objective O.LOAD from
                             [3].
                             AppNote: Each application loaded onto the TOE has been signed by a VA. The VA
                             will guarantee that the security policies established by the card issuer on applications

                             application loading.

OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS             Domain Rights
                             The Card issuer shall not get access or change personalized AP Security Domain
                             keys which belong to the AP. Modification of a Security Domain keyset is restricted to
                             the AP who owns the security domain.
                             AppNote: APs have a set of keys that allows them to establish a secure channel
                             between them and the platform. These keys sets are not known by the TOE issuer.
                             The security domain initial keys are changed before any operation on the SD (OE.KEY-CHANGE).

OT.COMM_AUTH                 Communication Mutual Authentication
                             The TOE shall authenticate the origin of the card management requests that the card
                             receives, and authenticate itself to the remote actor.

OT.COMM_INTEGRITY            Communication Request Integrity
                             The TOE shall verify the integrity of the card management requests that the card
                             receives.

OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY      Communication Request Confidentiality
                             The TOE shall be able to process card management requests containing encrypted
                             data.


5.1.6      Card Management
OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT           Card Management
                             The TOE shall provide card management functionalities (loading, installation, extradition,
                             deletion of applications and GP registry updates) in charge of the life cycle of the
                             whole device and installed applications (applets). The card manager, the application
                             with specific rights responsible for the administration of the smart card, shall control
                             the access to card management functions. It shall also implement the card issuer’s
                             policy on card management.
                             The Security Objective from [3] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is
                             listed as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card
                             Manager belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refinement
                             for the Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [3]. Thus, the
                             following objectives are also covered:

                                • The TOE shall ensure that the installation of an applet performs as expected
                                     (See SA.INSTALL for details).
                                • The TOE shall ensure that the loading of a package into the card is secure.
                                • The TOE shall ensure that the deletion of a package from the TOE is secure.

                            AppNote: The card manager will be tightly connected in practice with the rest of
                            the TOE, which in return shall very likely rely on the card manager for the effective
                            enforcement of some of its security functions. The mechanism used to ensure authentication
                            of the TOE issuer, that manages the TOE, or of the Service Providers owning a
                            Security Domain with card management privileges is a secure channel. This channel
                            will be used afterwards to protect commands exchanged with the TOE in confidentiality
                            and integrity. The platform guarantees that only the ISD or the Service Providers
                            owning a Security Domain with the appropriate privilege (Delegated Management)
                            can manage the applications on the card associated with its Security Domain. This
                            is done accordingly with the card issuer’s policy on card management. The actor
                            performing the operation must beforehand authenticate with the Security Domain. In
                            the case of Delegated Management, the card management command will be associated
                            with an electronic signature (GlobalPlatform token) verified by the ISD before execution.
                            The Security Objective from [3] for the environment OE.CARD-MANAGEMENT is
                            listed as TOE Security Objective OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT for the TOE as the Card
                            Manager belongs to the TOE for this evaluation. This security objective is a refinement
                            for the Security Objectives O.INSTALL, O.LOAD, and O.DELETION from [3]. Thus, the
                            following AppNote applicable to O.DELETION applies also:

                                 • Usurpation of identity resulting from a malicious installation of an applet on the
                                   card may also be the result of perturbing the communication channel linking
                                   the CAD and the card. Even if the CAD is placed in a secure environment,
                                   the attacker may try to capture, duplicate, permute or modify the packages sent
                                   to the card. He may also try to send one of its own applications as if it came
                                   from the card issuer. Thus, this objective is intended to ensure the integrity and
                                   authenticity of loaded CAP files.


5.1.7      Smart Card Platform
OT.SCP.IC                   IC Physical Protection
                            The SCP shall provide all IC security features against physical attacks. This security
                            objective for the environment refers to the point (7) of the security aspect SA.SCP.

                                 instance random numbers shall not be predictable and shall have sufficient entropy.
                                 The TOE will ensure that no information about the produced random numbers is
                                 available to an attacker since they might be used for instance to generate cryptographic
                                 keys.


5.1.9      OS Update Mechanism
OT.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LO        Confidentiality of Update Image - Load
AD
                                 The TOE shall ensure that the encrypted image transferred to the device is not
                                 disclosed during the installation. The keys used for decrypting the image shall be
                                 kept confidential.

OT.AUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE Authorization of Update Image - Load
                                 The TOE shall ensure that it is only possible to load an authorized image.

The following Security Objectives have been added to comply to JIL "Security requirements for post-delivery code
loading" [31].
OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE             Secure loading of the Additional Code
                                 The Loader of the Initial TOE shall check an evidence of authenticity and integrity of
                                 the loaded Additional Code. The Loader enforces that only the allowed version of the

                              Additional Code can be loaded on the Initial TOE. The Loader shall forbid the loading
                              of an Additional Code not intended to be assembled with the Initial TOE. During the
                              Load Phase of an Additional Code, the TOE shall remain secure.

OT.SECURE_AC_ACTIVATION       Secure activation of the Additional Code
                              Activation of the Additional Code and update of the Identification Data shall be performed
                              at the same time in an Atomic way. All the operations needed for the code to be able
                              to operate as in the Final TOE shall be completed before activation. If the Atomic
                              Activation is successful, then the resulting product is the Final TOE, otherwise (in
                              case of interruption or incident which prevents the forming of the Final TOE), the
                              Initial TOE shall remain in its initial state or fail secure.

OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION         Secure identification of the TOE
                              The Identification Data identifies the Initial TOE and Additional Code. The TOE
                              provides means to store Identification Data in its non-volatile memory and guarantees
                              the integrity of these data. After Atomic Activation of the Additional Code, the Identification
                              Data of the Final TOE allows identifications of Initial TOE and Additional Code. The
                              user shall be able to uniquely identify Initial TOE and Additional Code(s) which are
                              embedded in the Final TOE.


5.1.10     Config Applet
OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION         Card Configuration
                              The TOE shall ensure that the customer can only configure customer configuration
                              items and that NXP can configure customer and NXP configuration items. Additionally,
                              the customer can only disable the customer configuration and NXP can disable customer
                              and NXP configuration.


5.1.11     Restricted Mode
OT.ATTACK-COUNTER             Attack Counter
                              The TOE shall ensure that the Attack Counter can only be reset by the ISD or by
                              application of an ECC signed token.

OT.RESTRICTED-MODE            Restricted Mode
                              The TOE shall ensure that in Restricted Mode all operations return an error except for
                              the limited set of commands that are allowed by the TOE when in Restricted Mode.


5.1.12     Applet Migration
OT.DATASTORE_ACCESS           Datastore Access
                              The TOE shall ensure that only an authorized applet instance can access data from
                              the datastore based on its AID. An applet instance is triggered to import/export data
                              in the datastore only by authentic commands

5.2        Security Objectives for the Operational Environment
OE.APPLET                   Applet
                            No applet loaded post-issuance shall contain native methods.

OE.VERIFICATION             Bytecode Verification
                            All the bytecodes shall be verified at least once, before the loading, before the installation
                            or before the execution, depending on the card capabilities, in order to ensure that
                            each bytecode is valid at execution time. See SA.VERIFICATION for details.
                            Additionally, the applet shall follow all the recommendations, if any, mandated in the
                            platform guidance for maintaining the isolation property of the platform.
                            Application Note:
                            Constraints to maintain the isolation property of the platform are provided by the
                            platform developer in application development guidance. The constraints apply to
                            all application code loaded in the platform.

OE.CODE-EVIDENCE            Code Evidence
                            For application code loaded pre-issuance, evaluated technical measures implemented
                            by the TOE or audited organizational measures must ensure that loaded application
                            has not been changed since the code verifications required in OE.VERIFICATION.
                            For application code loaded post-issuance and verified off-card according to the requirements
                            of OE.VERIFICATION, the verification authority shall provide digital evidence to the
                            TOE that the application code has not been modified after the code verification and
                            that he is the actor who performed code verification.
                            For application code loaded post-issuance and partially or entirely verified on-card,
                            technical measures must ensure that the verification required in OE.VERIFICATION
                            are performed. On-card bytecode verifier is out of the scope of this Protection Profile.
                            Application Note: For application code loaded post-issuance and verified off-card,
                            the integrity and authenticity evidence can be achieved by electronic signature of the
                            application code, after code verification, by the actor who performed verification.

OE.APPS-PROVIDER            Application Provider
                            The AP shall be a trusted actor that provides applications. The AP is responsible for
                            its security domain keys.

OE.VERIFICATION-AUTHORITY   Verification Authority
                            The VA should be a trusted actor who is able to verify bytecode of an application
                            loaded on the card, guarantee and generate the digital signature attached to an
                            application and ensure that its public key for verifying the application signature is
                            on the TOE.

OE.KEY-CHANGE               Security Domain Key Change
                            The AP must change its security domain initial keys before any operation on it.

                                   Secure TOE communication protocols shall be supported and used by the environment.



OE.USE_KEYS                        Protection of OPE keys
                                   During the TOE usage, the terminal or system in interaction with the TOE, shall ensure
                                   the protection (integrity and confidentiality) of their own keys by operational means
                                   and/or procedures.

OE.PROCESS_SEC_IC                  Protection during composite product manufacturing
                                   Security procedures shall be used after TOE Delivery up to delivery to the end-consumer
                                   to maintain confidentiality and integrity of the TOE and of its manufacturing and
                                   test data (to prevent any possible copy, modification, retention, theft or unauthorised
                                   use). This means that Phases after TOE Delivery up to the end of Phase 6 must be
                                   protected appropriately.

OE.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.CR          Confidentiality of Update Image - CREATE
EATE
                                   The off-card Update Image Creator ensures that the image is signed and transferred
                                   encrypted to the device and is not disclosed during the creation and transfer. The
                                   keys used for signing and encrypting the image are kept confidential.


5.3        Security Objectives Rationale
In this section it is proven that the security objectives described in Chapter 4 can be traced for all aspects identified
in the TOE-security environment and that they are suited to cover them. At least one security objective results
from each assumption, OSP, and each threat. At least one threat, one OSP or assumption exists for each security
objective.

5.3.1      Threats
5.3.1.1 Confidentiality
T.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD

           Objective                       Rationale
           OT.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.LOAD     Counters    the    threat   by   ensuring   the   confidentiality        of
                                           D.UPDATE_IMAGE during installing it on the TOE.
           OE.CONFID-UPDATE-IMAGE.CREATE Counters the threat by ensuring that the D.UPDATE_IMAGE
                                           is not transfered in plain and that the keys are kept secret.


T.CONFID-APPLI-DATA

           Objective                       Rationale
           OT.SID                          Counters this threat by providing correct identification of applets.
           OT.FIREWALL                     Counters this threat by providing the Java Card Virtual Machine
                                           Firewall as specified in [5].
           OT.GLOBAL_ARRAYS_CONFID         Counters this threat by preventing the disclosure of the
                                           information stored in the APDU buffer.
           OT.OPERATE                      Counters the threat by ensuring that the firewall, which is
                                           dynamically enforced, shall never stop operating.
           OT.REALLOCATION                 Counters this threat by preventing any attempt to read a piece
                                           of information that was previously used by an application but has
                                           been logically deleted. It states that any information that was
                                           formerly stored in a memory block shall be cleared before the
                                           block is reused.
           OT.ALARM                        Counters this threat by obtaining clear warning and error
                                           messages from the firewall, which is a software tool automating
                                           critical controls, so that the appropriate countermeasure can be
                                           taken.
           OT.CIPHER                       Contributes to counter this threat by protecting the data shared or
                                           information communicated between applets and the CAD using
                                           cryptographic functions.
           OT.KEY-MNGT                     Counters this threat by providing appropriate management of
                                           keys, PIN’s which are particular cases of an application’s
                                           sensitive data.
           OT.PIN-MNGT                     Counters this threat by providing appropriate management of
                                           keys, PIN’s which are particular cases of an application’s
                                           sensitive data.
           OT.TRANSACTION                  Counters this threat by providing appropriate management of
                                           keys, PIN’s which are particular cases of an application’s
                                           sensitive data.

           OE.VERIFICATION      Contributes to counter the threat by checking the bytecode.
           OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT   Contributes to counter this threat by controlling the access to card

T.CONFID-JCS-CODE

           Objective            Rationale
           OT.NATIVE            Counters this threat by ensuring that no native applications can
                                be run to modify a piece of code.
           OE.VERIFICATION      Contributes to counter the threat by checking the bytecode.
           OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT   Contributes to counter this threat by controlling the access to card
                                management functions.

           OT.NATIVE              Counters this threat by ensuring that no native code can be run
                                  to modify a piece of code.
           OE.VERIFICATION        Contributes to counter the threat by checking the bytecode.
                                  Bytecode verification ensures that each of the instructions used
                                  on the Java Card platform is used for its intended purpose and in
                                  the intended scope of accessibility. As none of these instructions
                                  enables modifying a piece of code, no Java Card applet can
                                  therefore be executed to modify a piece of code.
           OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT     Contributes to counter this threat by controlling the access to card
                                  management functions.
           OE.CODE-EVIDENCE       The objective OE.CODE-EVIDENCE contributes to counter this
                                  threat by ensuring that integrity and authenticity evidences exist
                                  for the application code loaded into the platform.

                                  card management functions such as the installation, update or
                                  deletion of applets.
           OE.CODE-EVIDENCE       Contributes to counter this threat by ensuring that the application
                                  code loaded into the platform has not been changed after code
                                  verification, which ensures code integrity and authenticity.
           OT.APPLI-AUTH          Counters this threat by ensuring that the loading of packages is
                                  done securely and thus preserves the integrity of packages code.

                                   stored in the APDU buffer.      Application data that is sent to
                                   the applet as clear text arrives in the APDU buffer, which is a
                                   resource shared by all applications.
          OT.OPERATE               Counters the threat by ensuring that the firewall, which is
                                   dynamically enforced, shall never stop operating.
          OT.REALLOCATION          Counters the threat by preventing any attempt to read a piece of
                                   information that was previously used by an application but has
                                   been logically deleted. It states that any information that was
                                   formerly stored in a memory block shall be cleared before the
                                   block is reused.
          OT.ALARM                 Contributes to counter this threat by obtaining clear warning

          OT.CIPHER                Contributes to counter this threat by protecting the data shared or
                                   information communicated between applets and the CAD using
                                   cryptographic functions.
          OT.KEY-MNGT              Counters this threat by providing appropriate management of
                                   keys, PINs which are particular cases of an application’s sensitive

           Objective              Rationale
           OT.SID                 Counters this threat by providing unique subject identification.
           OT.FIREWALL            Contributes to counter this threat by providing means of
                                  separation.
           OT.OPERATE             Counters the threat by ensuring that the firewall shall never stop
                                  operating.
           OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT     Contributes to counter this threat by ensuring that installing an
                                  applet has no effect on the state of other applets and thus can’t
                                  change the TOE’s attribution of privileged roles.
           OT.SCP.RECOVERY        Intended to support the OT.OPERATE and objectives of the
                                  TOE, thus indirectly related to the threats that these objectives
                                  contribute to counter.
           OT.SCP.SUPPORT         Intended to support the OT.OPERATE and objectives of the TOE,
                                  thus indirectly related to the threats that these latter objectives
                                  contribute to counter.


5.3.1.4 Unauthorized Excecution
T.EXE-CODE.1

           Objective              Rationale
           OT.FIREWALL            Counters the threat by preventing the execution of non-shareable
                                  methods of a class instance by any subject apart from the class
                                  instance owner.
           OE.VERIFICATION        Contributes to counter the threat by checking the bytecodes.
                                  Bytecode verification ensures that each of the instructions used
                                  on the Java Card platform is used for its intended purpose and in
                                  the intended scope of accessibility. As none of these instructions
                                  enables modifying a piece of code, no Java Card applet can
                                  therefore be executed to modify a piece of code.


T.EXE-CODE.2

           Objective              Rationale
           OE.VERIFICATION        Contributes to counter the threat by checking the bytecodes.
                                  Bytecode verification ensures that each of the instructions used
                                  on the Java Card platform is used for its intended purpose and
                                  in the intended scope of accessibility. Especially the control flow
                                  confinement and the validity of the method references used in the
                                  bytecodes are guaranteed.

           Objective            Rationale
           OT.NATIVE            Counters this threat by ensuring that a Java Card applet can only
                                access native methods indirectly that is, through an API.
           OE.APPLET            Contributes to counter this threat by ensuring that no native
                                applets shall be loaded in post-issuance.
           OE.VERIFICATION      Contributes to counter the threat by checking the bytecodes.
                                Bytecode verification also prevents the program counter of an
                                applet to jump into a piece of native code by confining the control
                                flow to the currently executed method.


5.3.1.5 Denial of Service
T.RESOURCES

           Objective            Rationale
           OT.OPERATE           Counters the threat by ensuring correct working order.
           OT.RESOURCES         Counteres      the    threat     directly   by     objectives           on
                                resource-management.
           OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT   Counters this threat by controlling the consumption of resources
                                during installation and other card management operations.
           OT.SCP.RECOVERY      Intended to support the OT.OPERATE and OT.RESOURCES
                                objectives of the TOE, thus indirectly related to the threats that
                                these objectives contribute to counter.
           OT.SCP.SUPPORT       Intended to support the OT.OPERATE and OT.RESOURCES
                                objectives of the TOE, thus indirectly related to the threats that
                                these objectives contribute to counter.


5.3.1.6 Card Management
T.UNAUTHORIZED_CARD_MNGT

           Objective            Rationale
           OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT   Contributes to counter this threat by controlling the access to
                                card management functions such as the loading, installation,
                                extradition or deletion of applets.
           OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS     Contributes to counter this threat by restricting the modification
                                of an AP security domain keyset to the AP who owns it.
           OT.COMM_AUTH         Contributes to counter this threat by preventing unauthorized
                                users from initiating a malicious card management operation.
           OT.COMM_INTEGRITY    Contributes to counter this threat by protecting the integrity of the
                                card management data while it is in transit to the TOE.
           OT.APPLI-AUTH        Counters this threat by ensuring that the loading of a package is
                                safe.

           OT.COMM_CONFIDENTIALITY   Contributes to counter this threat by preventing from disclosing
                                     encrypted data transiting to the TOE


T.LIFE_CYCLE

           Objective                 Rationale
           OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT        Contributes to counter this threat by controlling the access to
                                     card management functions such as the loading, installation,
                                     extradition or deletion of applets
           OT.DOMAIN-RIGHTS          Contributes to counter this threat by restricting the use of an
                                     AP security domain keysets, and thus the management of the
                                     applications related to this SD, to the AP who owns it


5.3.1.7 Services
T.OBJ-DELETION

           Objective                 Rationale
           OT.OBJ-DELETION           Counters this threat by ensuring that object deletion shall not
                                     break references to objects.


5.3.1.8 Miscellaneous
T.PHYSICAL

           Objective                 Rationale
           OT.SCP.IC                 Counters phyiscal attacks.       Physical protections rely on the
                                     underlying platform and are therefore an environmental issue.
           OT.RESTRICTED-MODE        Contributes to counter the threat by ensuring that if the limit of the
                                     Attack Counter is reached only limited functionality is available.

           Objective                   Rationale
           OT.RND                      Counters the threat by ensuring the cryptographic quality of
                                       random number generation. For instance random numbers shall
                                       not be predictable and shall have sufficient entropy. Furthermore,
                                       the TOE ensures that no information about the produced random
                                       numbers is available to an attacker.


5.3.1.10 Config Applet
T.CONFIG

           Objective                   Rationale
           OT.CARD-CONFIGURATION       Counters the threat by ensuring that the customer can only
                                       read and write customer configuration items using the Customer
                                       Configuration Token and NXP can read and write configuration
                                       items using the NXP Configuration Token. If access is disabled
                                       configuration items can not be read or written.


5.3.1.11 OS Update
T.UNAUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE

           Objective                   Rationale
           OT.SECURE_LOAD_ACODE        Counters the threat directly by ensuring that only authorized
                                       (allowed version) images can be installed.
           OT.AUTH-LOAD-UPDATE-IMAGE   Counters the threat directly by ensuring that only authorized

                                       in a secure state after interruption of the OS Update procedure
                                       (Load Phase).
           OT.TOE_IDENTIFICATION       Counters     the    threat     directly   by      ensuring         that
                                       D.TOE_IDENTIFICATION is only updated after successful
                                       OS Update procedure.
           OT.SECURE_AC_ACTIVATION     Counters the threat directly by ensuring that the update OS is
                                       only activated after successful (atomic) OS Update procedure.

5.3.1.13 Applet Migration
T.AM_DATASTORE_ACCESS

           Objective                  Rationale
           OT.DATASTORE_ACCESS        Counters the threat by verifying that only an authorized applet
                                      instance is able to import data from the datastore.                 The
                                      verification is based on the AID of the applet.        Data import
                                      from the datastore by an applet instance can be done only by a
                                      trusted entity authentified either by sending the import command
                                      via a scp or via untrusted channel using signature and chained
                                      hashes.


5.3.2      Organisational Security Policies
OSP.VERIFICATION

           Objective                  Rationale
           OE.VERIFICATION            Enforces the OSP by guaranteeing that all the bytecodes shall be
                                      verified at least once, before the loading, before the installation
                                      or before the execution in order to ensure that each bytecode is
                                      valid at execution time.
           OT.CARD-MANAGEMENT         Contributing to enforce the OSP by ensuring that the loading of a
                                      package into the card is safe.
           OE.CODE-EVIDENCE           This policy is enforced by the security objective of the
                                      environment     OE.CODE-EVIDENCE            which    ensures        that

6          Extended Components Definition (ASE_ECD)
6.1        Definition of Family ”Generation of random numbers (FCS_RNG)”
This section has been taken over from the certified (BSI-PP-0084-2014) Smartcard IC Platform Protection Profile
[12].

6.1.1       Family behavior
This family defines quality requirements for the generation of random numbers which are intended to be use for
cryptographic purposes.
Component leveling:




                                        Fig. 6.1: Random Number Generation


FCS_RNG                Generation of random numbers requires that random numbers meet a defined quality metric.

Management:            FCS_RNG.1
                       There are no management activities foreseen.

Audit:                 FCS_RNG.1
                       There are no actions defined to be auditable.
FCS_RNG.1              Random Number Generation.

Hierarchical to:       No other components.

Dependencies           No dependencies.

FCS_RNG.1.1            The TSF shall provide a [selection: physical, non-physical true, deterministic, hybrid physical,
                       hybrid deterministic] random number generator that implements: [assignment: list of security
                       capabilities].

FCS_RNG.1.2            The TSF shall provide [selection: bits, octets of bits, numbers [assignment: format of the
                       numbers]] that meet [assignment: a defined quality metric].

                       Application Note: A physical random number generator (RNG) produces the random number by
                       a noise source based on physical random processes. A non-physical true RNG uses a noise
                       source based on non-physical random processes like human interaction (key strokes, mouse
                       movement). A deterministic RNG uses an random seed to produce a pseudorandom output. A
                       hybrid RNG combines the principles of physical and deterministic RNGs where a hybrid physical
                       RNG produces at least the amount of entropy the RNG output may contain and the internal state
                       of a hybrid deterministic RNG output contains fresh entropy but less than the output of RNG may
                       contain.

6.2        Definition of Family ”Audit Data Storage (FAU_SAS)”
This section has been taken over from the certified (BSI-PP-0084-2014) Smartcard IC Platform Protection Profile
[12]. To define the security functional requirements of the TOE an additional family (”Audit Data Storage (FAU_SAS)”)
of the Class ”Security audit (FAU)” is defined here. This family describes the functional requirements for the
storage of audit data. It has a more general approach than FAU_GEN, because it does not necessarily require
the data to be generated by the TOE itself and because it does not give specific details of the content of the audit
records.

6.2.1      Family behavior
This family defines functional requirements for the storage of audit data.
Component leveling:

                        of audit information] in the [assignment: type of persistent memory].


6.3        Definition of Family ”TOE emanation (FPT_EMSEC)”
This section has been taken over from the certified (BSI-PP-0085) Protection Profile Machine Readable Travel
Document with ICAO Application, Basic Access Control [ [29]]. The additional family FPT_EMSEC (TOE Emanation)
of the Class FPT - ’Protection of the TSF’ is defined here to describe the IT security functional requirements of the
TOE. The TOE shall prevent attacks against the TOE and other secret data where the attack is based on external
observable physical phenomena of the TOE. Examples of such attacks are evaluation of TOEs electromagnetic
radiation, simple power analysis (SPA), differential power analysis (DPA), timing attacks, etc. This family describes
the functional requirements for the limitation of intelligible emanations which are not directly addressed by any
other component of Common Criteria part 2 [9].

7          Security Requirements (ASE_REQ)
This section states the security functional requirements for the TOE. For readability requirements are arranged
into groups taken from [3]. The permitted operations (assignment, iteration, selection and refinement) of the
SFRs taken from Common Criteria [9] are printed in bold. Completed operations related to the PP are additionally
marked within [ ] where assignments are additionally marked with the keyword "assignment".

              Group                        Description
              Core with Logical Channels   The CoreG_LC contains the requirements concerning the
              (CoreG_LC)                   runtime environment of the Java Card System implementing
                                           logical channels.      This includes the firewall policy and the
                                           requirements related to the Java Card API. Logical channels are
                                           a Java Card specification version 2.2 feature. This group is the
                                           union of requirements from the Core (CoreG) and the logical
                                           channels (LCG) groups defined in [4] (cf. Java Card System
                                           Protection Profile Collection [4]).
              Installation (InstG)         The InstG contains the security requirements concerning the
                                           installation of post-issuance applications. It does not address
                                           card management issues in the broad sense, but only those
                                           security aspects of the installation procedure that are related to
                                           applet execution.
              Applet deletion (ADELG)      The ADELG contains the security requirements for erasing
                                           installed applets from the card, a feature introduced in Java Card
                                           specification version 2.2.
              Remote Method Invocation     The RMIG contains the security requirements for the remote
              (RMIG)                       method invocation feature, which provides a new protocol of
                                           communication between the terminal and the applets. This was
                                           introduced in Java Card specification version 2.2.
              Object deletion (ODELG)      The ODELG contains the security requirements for the object
                                           deletion capability.   This provides a safe memory recovering
                                           mechanism. This is a Java Card specification version 2.2 feature.
              Secure carrier (CarG)        The CarG group contains minimal requirements for secure
                                           downloading of applications on the card. This group contains the
                                           security requirements for preventing, in those configurations that
                                           do not support on-card static or dynamic bytecode verification,

charge of the bytecode verification of the applications may be just an alias for the card issuer. Subjects (prefixed
with an "S") are described in the following table:

             Subject                      Description
             S.ADEL                       The applet deletion manager which also acts on behalf of the
                                          card issuer. It may be an applet ([5], §11), but its role asks
                                          anyway for a specific treatment from the security viewpoint. This
                                          subject is unique and is involved in the ADEL security policy.
             S.CAD                        The CAD represents the actor that requests services by issuing
                                          commands to the card. It also plays the role of the off-card entity
                                          that communicates with the S.INSTALLER.
             S.INSTALLER                  The installer is the on-card entity which acts on behalf of the card
                                          issuer. This subject is involved in the loading of packages and
                                          installation of applets.
             S.JCRE                       The runtime environment under which Java programs in a smart
                                          card are executed.
             S.JCVM                       The bytecode interpreter that enforces the firewall at runtime.
             S.LOCAL                      Operand stack of a JCVM frame, or local variable of a JCVM
                                          frame containing an object or an array of references.
             S.SD                         A GlobalPlatform Security Domain representing on the card a
                                          off-card entity.   This entity can be the Issuer, an Application
                                          Provider, the Controlling Authority or the Verification Authority.
             S.MEMBER                     Any object’s field, static field or array position.
             S.PACKAGE                    A package is a namespace within the Java programming
                                          language that may contain classes and interfaces, and in the
                                          context of Java Card technology, it defines either a user library,
                                          or one or several applets.
             S.OSU                        OSU provides secure functionality to update the TOE operating
                                          system with an image created by a trusted off-card entity
                                          (S.UpdateImageCreator)
             S.UpdateImageCreator         The off-card Update Image Creator ensures that the image
                                          is signed and transferred encrypted to the device and is not
                                          disclosed during the creation and transfer. The keys used for
                                          signing and encrypting the image are kept confidential.
             S.Archive_Manager            Handles incoming Applet Migration APDU Commands and
                                          access to the O.APPLET_MIGRATION_DATASTORE.
             S.Customer                   The subject that has the Customer Configuration Token.
             S.NXP                        The subject that has the NXP Configuration Token.
             S.ACAdmin                    The subject that has the Attack Counter Token Key.

AppNote                        It should be noticed that accessing array’s components of a static array, and more generally
                               fields and methods of static objects, is an access to the corresponding O.JAVAOBJECT.

                           In the case of an array type, fields are components of the array ([4], §2.14, §2.7.7), as
                           well as the length; the only methods of an array object are those inherited from the Object
                           class.
                           The Sharing attribute defines four categories of objects:

                              • Standard ones, whose both fields and methods are under the firewall policy,
                              • Shareable interface Objects (SIO), which provide a secure mechanism for inter-applet
                                 communication,
                              • JCRE entry points (Temporary or Permanent), who have freely accessible methods
                                 but protected fields,
                              • Global arrays, having both unprotected fields (including components; refer to JavaCardClass
                                 discussion above) and methods.

                           When a new object is created, it is associated with the Currently Active Context. But the
                           object is owned by the applet instance within the Currently Active Context when the object
                           is instantiated ([5], §6.1.3). An object is owned by an applet instance, by the JCRE or
                           by the package library where it has been defined (these latter objects can only be arrays
                           that initialize static fields of packages).
                           ([5], Glossary) Selected Applet Context. The Java Card RE keeps track of the currently
                           selected Java Card applet. Upon receiving a SELECT command with this applet’s AID,
                           the Java Card RE makes this applet the Selected Applet Context. The Java Card RE
                           sends all APDU commands to the Selected Applet Context.
                           While the expression ”Selected Applet Context” refers to a specific installed applet, the
                           relevant aspect to the policy is the context (package AID) of the selected applet. In this
                           policy, the ”Selected Applet Context” is the AID of the selected package.
                           ([5], §6.1.2.1) At any point in time, there is only one active context within the Java Card
                           VM (this is called the Currently Active Context).
                           It should be noticed that the invocation of static methods (or access to a static field) is
                           not considered by this policy, as there are no firewall rules. They have no effect on the
                           active context as well and the ”acting package” is not the one to which the static method
                           belongs to in this case.
                           It should be noticed that the Java Card platform, version 2.2.x and version 3 Classic
                           Edition, introduces the possibility for an applet instance to be selected on multiple logical
                           channels at the same time, or accepting other applets belonging to the same package
                           being selected simultaneously. These applets are referred to as multiselectable applets.
                           Applets that belong to a same package are either all multiselectable or not ([6], §2.2.5).
                           Therefore, the selection mode can be regarded as an attribute of packages. No selection
                           mode is defined for a library package.
                           An applet instance will be considered an active applet instance if it is currently selected in
                           at least one logical channel. An applet instance is the currently selected applet instance

AppNote                     The storage of temporary Java Card RE-owned objects references is runtime-enforced
                            ([5], §6.2.8.1-3).
                            It should be noticed that this policy essentially applies to the execution of bytecode. Native
                            methods, the Java Card RE itself and possibly some API methods can be granted specific
                            rights or limitations through the FDP_IFF.1.3[JCVM] to FDP_IFF.1.5[JCVM] elements.
                            The way the Java Card virtual machine manages the transfer of values on the stack
                            and local variables (returned values, uncaught exceptions) from and to internal registers
                            is implementation dependent. For instance, a returned reference, depending on the
                            implementation of the stack frame, may transit through an internal register prior to being
                            pushed on the stack of the invoker. The returned bytecode would cause more than one
                            OP.PUT operation under this scheme.

FMT_MSA.2.1[FIREWALL-JCVM] The TSF shall ensure that only secure values are accepted for [assignment: all the
                             security attributes of subjects and objects defined in the FIREWALL access control

AppNote                      The following rules are given as examples only. For instance, the last two rules are
                             motivated by the fact that the Java Card API defines only transient arrays factory methods.
                             Future versions may allow the creation of transient objects belonging to arbitrary classes;
                             such evolution will naturally change the range of ”secure values” for this component.

                                 • The Context attribute of an O.JAVAOBJECT must correspond to that of an installed
                                  applet or be ”Java Card RE”.
                                 • An O.JAVAOBJECT whose Sharing attribute is a Java Card RE entry point or a
                                  global array necessarily has ”Java Card RE” as the value for its Context security
                                  attribute.
                                 • An O.JAVAOBJECT whose Sharing attribute value is a global array necessarily has
                                  ”array of primitive type” as a JavaCardClass security attribute’s value.
                                 • Any O.JAVAOBJECT whose Sharing attribute value is not ”Standard” has a PERSISTENT-
                                  LifeTime attribute’s value.
                                 • Any O.JAVAOBJECT whose LifeTime attribute value is not PERSISTENT has an
                                  array type as JavaCardClass attribute’s value.

                                   • Objects’ security attributes of the access control policy are created and initialized
                                       at the creation of the object or the subject. Afterwards, these attributes are no
                                       longer mutable (FMT_MSA.1[JCRE]). At the creation of an object (OP.CREATE),
                                       the newly created object, assuming that the FIREWALL access control SFP permits
                                       the operation, gets its Lifetime and Sharing attributes from the parameters of the
                                       operation; on the contrary, its Context attribute has a default value, which is its
                                       creator’s Context attribute and AID respectively ([5], §6.1.3). There is one default
                                       value for the Selected Applet Context that is the default applet identifier’s Context,
                                       and one default value for the Currently Active Context that is ”Java Card RE”.
                                   • The knowledge of which reference corresponds to a temporary entry point object or
                                       a global array and which does not is solely available to the Java Card RE (and the

                                       values of the security attributes. It should be noticed that creation of objects is an

                                       anyway if the created object would have had security attributes whose value violates

7.1.1.2    Application Programming Interface
The following SFRs are related to the Java Card API. The whole set of cryptographic algorithms is generally not
implemented because of limited memory resources and/or limitations due to exportation. Therefore, the following
requirements only apply to the implemented subset. It should be noticed that the execution of the additional native
code is not within the TSF. Nevertheless, access to API native methods from the Java Card System is controlled
by TSF because there is no difference between native and interpreted methods in their interface or invocation
mechanism.

Dependencies                No dependencies.

FDP_RIP.1.1[APDU]           The TSF shall ensure that any previous information content of a resource is made unavailable
                            upon the [selection: allocation of the resource to] the following objects: [assignment:
                            the APDU buffer].

AppNote                     The allocation of a resource to the APDU buffer is typically performed as the result of a
                            call to the process() method of an applet.

Dependencies                No dependencies.

FDP_RIP.1.1[bArray]         The TSF shall ensure that any previous information content of a resource is made unavailable

                            the bArray object].

AppNote                     A resource is allocated to the bArray object when a call to an applet’s install() method
                            is performed. There is no conflict with FDP_ROL.1 here because of the bounds on
                            the rollback mechanism (FDP_ROL.1.2[FIREWALL]): the scope of the rollback does not
                            extend outside the execution of the install() method, and the de-allocation occurs precisely
                            right after the return of it.

Hierarchical-To             No other components.

Dependencies                No dependencies.

FDP_RIP.1.1[TRANSIENT]      The TSF shall ensure that any previous information content of a resource is made unavailable
                            upon the [selection: deallocation of the resource from] the following objects: [assignment:
                            any transient object].

AppNote                        • The events that provoke the de-allocation of any transient object are described in
                                 [5], §5.1.
                               • The clearing of CLEAR_ON_DESELECT objects is not necessarily performed when
                                 the owner of the objects is deselected. In the presence of multiselectable applet
                                 instances, CLEAR_ON_DESELECT memory segments may be attached to applets
                                 that are active in different logical channels. Multiselectable applet instances within
                                 a same package must share the transient memory segment if they are concurrently
                                 active ([5], §4.2.)

Dependencies                [FDP_ACC.1 Subset access control, or FDP_IFC.1 Subset information flow control]

FDP_ROL.1.1[FIREWALL]       The TSF shall enforce [assignment: the FIREWALL access control SFP and the
                            JCVM information flow control SFP] to permit the rollback of the [assignment: operations
                            OP.JAVA(...) and OP.CREATE(Sharing, LifeTime)(*)] on the [assignment: object
                            O.JAVAOBJECT].
FDP_ROL.1.2[FIREWALL]       The TSF shall permit operations to be rolled back within the [assignment: scope of
                            a select(), deselect(), process(), install() or uninstall() call, notwithstanding the
                            restrictions given in [5], §7.7, within the bounds of the Commit Capacity ([5], §7.8),
                            and those described in [4]].

AppNote                     Transactions are a service offered by the APIs to applets. It is also used by some APIs
                            to guarantee the atomicity of some operation. This mechanism is either implemented
                            in Java Card platform or relies on the transaction mechanism offered by the underlying
                            platform. Some operations of the API are not conditionally updated, as documented in
                            [4] (see for instance, PIN-blocking, PIN-checking, update of Transient objects).

FDP_SDI.2.1                 The TSF shall monitor user data stored in containers controlled by the TSF for [assignment:
                            integrity errors] on all objects, based on the following attributes: [assignment: integrity
                            protected data].
FDP_SDI.2.2                 Upon detection of a data integrity error, the TSF shall [assignment: reset the card
                            session for integrity errors ].

Refinement                  The following data elements have the user data attribute ”integrity protected data”:

                               • D.APP_KEYs
                               • D.PIN
                               • D.TOE_IDENTIFIER

AppNote                        • Although no such requirement is mandatory in the Java Card specification, at least
                                 an exception shall be raised upon integrity errors detection on cryptographic keys,
                                 PIN values and their associated security attributes. Even if all the objects cannot be
                                 monitored, cryptographic keys and PIN objects shall be considered with particular
                                 attention by ST authors as they play a key role in the overall security.
                               • It is also recommended to monitor integrity errors in the code of the native applications
                                 and Java Card applets.
                               • For integrity sensitive application, their data shall be monitored (D.APP_I_DATA):
                                 applications may need to protect information against unexpected modifications, and
                                 explicitly control whether a piece of information has been changed between two
                                 accesses. For example, maintaining the integrity of an electronic purse’s balance
                                 is extremely important because this value represents real money. Its modification
                                 must be controlled, for illegal ones would denote an important failure of the payment
                                 system.
                               • A dedicated library could be implemented and made available to developers to
                                 achieve better security for specific objects, following the same pattern that already
                                 exists in cryptographic APIs, for instance.

The list of SFRs of this category are taken from [3]. The SFR FDP_ITC.2[INSTALLER] has been refined and is
now part of the card management SFRs (FDP_ITC.2[CCM]) in section 7.1.6.
FMT_SMR.1[INSTALLER]        Security roles (INSTALLER)

Hierarchical-To             No other components.

Dependencies                FIA_UID.1 Timing of identification

FMT_SMR.1.1[INSTALLER]      The TSF shall maintain the roles: [assignment: Installer].

FPT_FLS.1.1[INSTALLER]      The TSF shall preserve a secure state when the following types of failures occur: [assignment:
                            the installer fails to load/install a package/applet as described in [5], §11.1.5 ].

AppNote                     The TOE may provide additional feedback information to the card manager in case of
                            potential security violations (see FAU_ARP.1).

FPT_RCV.3.1[INSTALLER]      When automated recovery from [assignment: none] is not possible, the TSF shall enter
                            a maintenance mode where the ability to return to a secure state is provided.
FPT_RCV.3.2[INSTALLER]      For [assignment: a failure during load/installation of a package/applet and deletion
                            of a package/applet/object], the TSF shall ensure the return of the TOE to a secure

                            ensure that the secure initial state is restored without exceeding [assignment: 0%] for
                            loss of TSF data or objects under the control of the TSF.
FPT_RCV.3.4[INSTALLER]      The TSF shall provide the capability to determine the objects that were or were not
                            capable of being recovered.

                                  • This element is not within the scope of the Java Card specification, which only
                                    mandates the behavior of the Java Card System in good working order. Further
                                    details on the ”maintenance mode” shall be provided in specific implementations.
                                    The following is an excerpt from [9], p298: In this maintenance mode normal operation
                                    might be impossible or severely restricted, as otherwise insecure situations might
                                    occur. Typically, only authorised users should be allowed access to this mode
                                    but the real details of who can access this mode is a function of FMT: Security
                                    management. If FMT: Security management does not put any controls on who can
                                    access this mode, then it may be acceptable to allow any user to restore the system
                                    if the TOE enters such a state. However, in practice, this is probably not desirable
                                    as the user restoring the system has an opportunity to configure the TOE in such a
                                    way as to violate the SFRs.

                               FPT_RCV.3.2[Installer]:

                                  • Should the installer fail during loading/installation of a package/applet, it has to
                                    revert to a ”consistent and secure state”. The Java Card RE has some clean up
                                    duties as well; see [5], §11.1.5 for possible scenarios. Precise behavior is left to
                                    implementers. This component shall include among the listed failures the deletion
                                    of a package/applet. See ([5], §11.3.4) for possible scenarios. Precise behavior is
                                    left to implementers.
                                  • Other events such as the unexpected tearing of the card, power loss, and so on,
                                    are partially handled by the underlying hardware platform (see [12]) and, from the
                                    TOE’s side, by events ”that clear transient objects” and transactional features. See
                                    FPT_FLS.1.1, FDP_RIP.1[TRANSIENT], FDP_RIP.1[ABORT] and
                                    FDP_ROL.1[FIREWALL].

                               FPT_RCV.3.3[Installer]:

                                  • The quantification is implementation dependent, but some facts can be recalled
                                    here. First, the SCP ensures the atomicity of updates for fields and objects, and a
                                    power-failure during a transaction or the normal runtime does not create the loss of
                                    otherwise permanent data, in the sense that memory on a smart card is essentially
                                    persistent with this respect (EEPROM). Data stored on the RAM and subject to
                                    such failure is intended to have a limited lifetime anyway (runtime data on the stack,
                                    transient objects’ contents). According to this, the loss of data within the TSF scope
                                    should be limited to the same restrictions of the transaction mechanism.

                            protection against these attacks is required ensuring that security functional requirements
                            are enforced. Hence, ”automatic response” means here (i) assuming that there might be
                            an attack at any time and (ii) countermeasures are provided at any time.

7.4.1      Rationale for Exclusion of Dependencies
The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[INSTALLER] is unsupported. This ST does not require the
identification of the "installer" since it can be considered as part of the TSF.
The dependency FIA_UID.1 of FMT_SMR.1[ADEL] is unsupported. This ST does not require the identification
of the "deletion manager" since it can be considered as part of the TSF.
The dependency FMT_SMF.1 of FMT_MSA.1[JCRE] is unsupported. The dependency between FMT_MSA.1[JCRE]
and FMT_SMF.1 is not satisfied because no management functions are required for the Java Card RE.
The dependency FAU_SAA.1 of FAU_ARP.1 is unsupported. The dependency of FAU_ARP.1 on FAU_SAA.1
assumes that a "potential security violation" generates an audit event. On the contrary, the events listed in
FAU_ARP.1 are self-contained (arithmetic exception, ill-formed bytecodes, access failure) and ask for a straightforward
reaction of the TSFs on their occurrence at runtime. The JCVM or other components of the TOE detect these
events during their usual working order. Thus, there is no mandatory audit recording in this ST.
The dependency FIA_UAU.1 of FIA_AFL.1[PIN] is unsupported. The TOE implements the firewall access
control SFP, based on which access to the object Implementing FIA_AFL.1[PIN] is organized.


7.5        Security Assurance Requirements Rationale
The selection of assurance components is based on the underlying PP [3].
The Security Target uses the augmentations from the PP, chooses EAL5 and adds the components AVA_VAN.5
and ALC_FLR.1.
The rationale for the augmentations is the same as in the PP.
The assurance level EAL5 is an elaborated pre-defined level of the CC, part 3 [10]. The assurance components
in an EAL level are chosen in a way that they build a mutually supportive and complete set of components. The
additional requirements chosen for augmentation do not add any dependencies, which are not already fulfilled
for the corresponding requirements contained in EAL5. Therefore, the components AVA_VAN.5, ALC_DVS.2,

SF.JCVM                  Java Card Virtual Machine

                         SF.JCVM provides the Java Card Virtual Machine including byte code interpretation and the Java
                         Card Firewall according to the specifications [5, 6]. This fulfills the SFRs FDP_IFC.1[JCVM],
                         FDP_IFF.1[JCVM], FMT_SMF.1, FMT_SMR.1, FDP_ROL.1[FIREWALL], FDP_ACF.1[FIREWALL],
                         FDP_ACC.2[FIREWALL] and FIA_UID.2[AID]. SF.JCVM supports FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1
                         by throwing Java Exceptions according to these specifications. Additionally it supports these
                         SFRs by verification of the integrity of used Java object headers.

                      fulfill FMT_MSA.1[JCRE] and FMT_MSA.1[JCVM]. All values for security attributes are initialized
                      and assigned by the system itself which fulfills FMT_MSA.2[FIREWALL-JCVM], FMT_MSA.3[FIREWALL],
                      and FMT_MSA.3[JCVM].
                      SF.JCVM ensures together with SF.PERS_MEM that the system is halted in case non existing
                      Java objects could be referenced after an aborted transaction to fulfill FDP_RIP.1[ABORT].

SF.AM                 Applet Migration

                      The SF.AM enables applet update while applet personalization data is preserved. In particular,
                      the implementation of the Applet Migration feature supports the functions for export and import
                      of applet data and thus, covers the SFR FMT_SMF.1[AMD].
                      The Applet Migration feature relies on the ArchiveManager component which controls and manages
                      the data import and export steps and so, stores the AIDs of the exporting and importing applets
                      instances. Thus, it enforces the SFR FMT_SMR.1[AMD].
                      The Applet Migration process relies on an access control policy based on old/new applet AIDs
                      which controls the access of applet instances to the migrated data. This enforces the SFRs
                      FDP_ACC.1[AMD] and FDP_ACF.1[AMD]. The AID of the exporting and importing applet instances
                      used in the access control policy can be set only by the ArchiveManager and thus, the Applet
                      Migration covers the SFR FMT_MSA.3[AMD] and FMT_MSA.1[AMD]. The ArchiveManager is
                      also the component setting the Applet Migration Plan and so satisfies FMT_MSA.3[AMD] and
                      FDP_IFC.2[AMD].
                      The Applet Migration process also requires authentication of the off card entity that sends the
                      Applet Migration commands for import and export. The import/export steps are performed either
                      via a secure channel protocol with authentication or via a proprietary protocol which uses an
                      electronic signature that is verified by a public key residing on the TOE. These measures satisfy
                      the SFRs FIA_UAU.5[AMD], FDP_IFF.1[AMD], FDP_IFC.2[AMD] and FIA_UID.1[AMD].
                      In case the export or import phase fail then the an exception is thrown and the system preserves
                      secure state. Thus, the Applet Migration functionality fulfills the SFR FPT_FLS.1[AMD]

SF.CONFIG             Configuration Management

                      SF.CONFIG provides means to store Initialization Data and Pre-personalization Data before TOE
                      delivery FAU_SAS.1[SCP].
                      SF.CONFIG provides means to change configurations of the card. Some configurations can be
                      changed by the customer and some can only be changed by NXP (FDP_IFC.2[CFG], FDP_IFF.1[CFG],
                      FMT_MSA.3[CFG], FMT_MSA.1[CFG], FMT_SMR.1[CFG], FMT_SMF.1[CFG], FIA_UID.1[CFG]).
                      SF.CONFIG supports FCS_COP.1 by configuring the behavior of cryptographic operations.
                      Additionally, SF.CONFIG provides proprietary commands to select (FIA_UID.1[SC]) the OS update
                      mechanism SF.OSU and to reset the OS to an initial state (FAU_ARP.1 and FPT_FLS.1).

8.3        Protection against Interference and Logical Tampering
The protection of JCOP against Interference and Logical Tampering is implemented in software within the TOE
and supported by the hardware of the micro controller.
The software protection of the TOE makes use of software security services which allow to detect and react on
manipulation of the TOE. Two types of reactions are used: If invalid data from outside the TOE is detected then it
is assumed that the TOE was used in a wrong way. This is indicated by an appropriate Status Word or Exception.
Detected deviations from the physical operating conditions and inconsistencies of internal states and program
flow however are considered to be an attack to the TOE. In such cases an internal Attack Counter is increased.
Once the Attack Counter reaches the maximum value, the TOE will go into Restricted Mode.
Typical software security mechanisms implemented in the TOE are e.g.:

     • Complex patterned values are used instead of boolean values which are sensible to tampering (only one bit
       needs to be changed to manipulate a false into a true).

     • Small random delays are inserted in the program flow to make successful physical interfering more difficult.

     • Secret information like Keys or PINs are stored encrypted in the TOE. The Masterkey to decrypt these is not
       accessible during normal operation.

     • Critical data is read after it has been written to non volatile memory.

     • Enhanced cryptographic support is based on the certified Security Software for DES, AES, ECC and RSA
       including protection against fault injection and random number generation.

     • Critical values (like PINs) are compared timing-invariant. This prevents from side channel attacks.

A full list of software countermeasures is contained in ADV_ARC.
Further protection against Tampering and Logical Interference is realized by the MMU implemented in hardware.
The MMU is able to perform access control to all types of memory. The special function registers access can be
restricted by the bridges between the CPU and the peripherals.
The JCOP defines several MMU contexts which restrict access to memory areas. The Master key is stored in
specific coprocessor registers and blocked for reading/writing during JCOP operation.
Additionally Interference and Logical Tampering is prevented by hardware security services. The JCOP runs on a
certified smart card HW platform which protects against bypass by physical and logical means such as:

     • cryptographic coprocessors (for symmetric and asymmetric cryptography) protected against DPA and DFA,

     • enhanced security sensors for clock frequency range, low and high temperature sensor, supply voltage
       sensors Single Fault Injection (SFI) attack detection, light sensors, and

     • encryption of data stored in persistent and transient memory.

8.4        Protection against Bypass of Security Related Actions
The JCOP prevents bypassing security related actions by several software counter measures. Different mechanisms
are used depending on the software environment.
Generally all input parameter are validated and in case of incorrect parameters the program flow is interrupted.
Such event is indicated by an appropriate Status Word or Exception. This prevents the TOE from being attacked
by undefined or unauthorized commands or data.
Basic protection is contributed by implementation of following standards within the TOE:

     • Java Applets are separated from each other as defined in the Java Card specifications [4, 5, 6]. The
       separation is achieved by implementation of the firewall which prevents Applets to access data belonging to
       a different Java Card context. Sharing information between different contexts is possible by supervision of
       the well defined Java Card Firewall mechanism implemented in the TOE.

     • Access to security relevant Applications in the TOE (like Security Domains) is protected by the Secure
       Channel mechanism defined by Global platform [21]. The secure channel allows access to Applications
       only if the secret keys are known. Further protection implemented in JCOP prevents brute force attacks to
       the secret keys of the Secure Channel.

The following mechanisms ensure that it is not possible to access information from the Java Layer without being
authorized to do so.

     • Status informations like Life Cycle of Applets or the Authentication State of a Secure Channel are stored in
       complex patterned values which protects them from manipulation.

     • Correct order of Java Card Byte Code execution is ensured by the Virtual Machine which detects if Byte
       Code of a wrong context is executed.

     • Correct processing of Byte Codes is ensured by checking at the beginning and end of Byte Code execution
       that the same Byte Code is executed.

Execution of native code in JCOP is protected by following mechanisms:

     • Critical execution paths of the TOE functionality are protected by program flow and call tree protection. This
       ensures that it is not possible to bypass security relevant checks and verifications.

     • Critical conditions are evaluated twice. This ensures that physical attacks on the compared values are
       detected during security relevant checks and verifications.

     • The true case in if-conditions leads to the less critical program flow or to an error case. This prevents attacks
       on the program flow during security relevant checks and verifications.

     • At the exit of critical loops it is checked that the whole loop was processed. This prevents from manipulation
       of the program flow and jumping out of the loop.

     • Critical parameters are check for consistency. This prevents from attacks with manipulated parameters.

Further protection is achieved by using different buffers for APDUs in case more than one physical interface is

10         Glossary
Additional Code Code activated by the Atomic Activation on the Initial TOE to generate the final TOE. For
     instance, Additional Code could: correct flaws, add new functionalities, update the operating system. Also
     referred to as D.UPDATE_IMAGE.

APDU buffer The APDU buffer is the buffer where the messages sent (received) by the card depart from (arrive
    to). The JCRE owns an APDU object (which is a JCRE Entry Point and an instance of the javacard.framework.APDU
    class) that encapsulates APDU messages in an internal byte array, called the APDU buffer. This object is
    made accessible to the currently selected applet when needed, but any permanent access (out-of selection-scope)
    is strictly prohibited for security reasons.

applet deletion manager The on-card component that embodies the mechanisms necessary to delete an applet
     or library and its associated data on smart cards using Java Card technology.

Atomic Activation The Loader guarantees at activation time that the loaded Additional Code is activated and
    that the Identification Data of the TOE is updated. This functionality is called Atomic Activation. If the Atomic
    Activation is successful, then the resulting product is the Final TOE, otherwise (in case of interruption or
    incident which prevents the forming of the Final TOE), the Initial TOE shall remain in its initial state or fail
    secure.

context A context is an object-space partition associated to a package. Applets within the same Java technology-based
     package belong to the same context. The firewall is the boundary between contexts (see "current context").

current context The JCRE keeps track of the current Java Card System context (also called "the active context").
     When a virtual method is invoked on an object, and a context switch is required and permitted, the current
     context is changed to correspond to the context of the applet that owns the object. When that method
     returns, the previous context is restored. Invocations of static methods have no effect on the current context.
     The current context and sharing status of an object together determine if access to an object is permissible.

currently selected applet The applet has been selected for execution in the current session. The Java Card RE
     keeps track of the currently selected Java Card applet. Upon receiving a SELECT command from the CAD
     or PCD with this applet’s AID, the Java Card RE makes this applet the currently selected applet over the I/O

default applet The applet that is selected after a card reset ([5], §4.1).

Final TOE The Final TOE is generated from the Initial TOE and the Additional Code. It is the resulting product of
      the Atomic Activation of the Additional Code onto the Initial TOE..

Initial TOE The Initial TOE is the product on which the Additional Code is loaded and with the Loader as part of
       the embedded software.

installer The installer is the on-card application responsible for the installation of applets on the card. It may
      perform (or delegate) mandatory security checks according to the card issuer policy (for bytecode-verification,
      for instance), loads and link packages (CAP file(s)) on the card to a suitable form for the Java Card VM to
      execute the code they contain. It is a subsystem of what is usually called “card manager”; as such, it can be
      seen as the portion of the card manager that belongs to the TOE.
      The installer has an AID that uniquely identifies him, and may be implemented as a Java Card applet.
      However, it is granted specific privileges on an implementation-specific manner ([5], §10).

Java Card RE The runtime environment under which Java programs in a smart card are executed. It is in charge
     of all the management features such as applet lifetime, applet isolation, object sharing, applet loading, applet
     initializing, transient objects, the transaction mechanism and so on.

Java Card RE Entry Point An object owned by the Java Card RE context but accessible by any application.
     These methods are the gateways through which applets request privileged Java Card RE services: the
     instance methods associated to those objects may be invoked from any context, and when that occurs, a
     context switch to the Java Card RE context is performed.
     There are two categories of Java Card RE Entry Point Objects: Temporary ones and Permanent ones. As
     part of the firewall functionality, the Java Card RE detects and restricts attempts to store references to these
     objects.

Java Card RMI Java Card Remote Method Invocation is the Java Card System version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition
     mechanism enabling a client application running on the CAD platform to invoke a method on a remote object
     on the card. Notice that in Java Card System, version 2.1.1, the only method that may be invoked from the
     CAD is the process method of the applet class and that in Java Card System, version 3 Classic Edition, this
     functionality is optional.

Java Card System Java Card System includes the Java Card RE, the Java Card VM, the Java Card API and the
     installer.

Java Card VM The embedded interpreter of bytecodes. The Java Card VM is the component that enforces
     separation between applications (firewall) and enables secure data sharing.

Load Phase The Load Phase is starting at the beginning of the Additional Code loading and ending at the end
    of Atomic Activation. During the Load Phase, the Initial TOE shall be in a secure state..

Loader The Loader is the software developed by the Product Manufacturer. It is used to load and activate the
    Additional Code into the Product FLASH or EEPROM memory. The Loader is included in the embedded
    software and is considered as part of the Initial TOE. see also UpdaterOS.

logical channel A logical link to an application on the card. A new feature of the Java Card System, version
     2.2 and 3 Classic Edition, that enables the opening of simultaneous sessions with the card, one per logical
     channel. Commands issued to a specific logical channel are forwarded to the active applet on that logical
     channel. Java Card platform, version 2.2.2 and 3 Classic Edition, enables opening up to twenty logical
     channels over each I/O interface (contacted or contactless).

MC FW Microcontroller Firmware. Firmware for booting and low level functionality of the Micro Controller.

NVRAM Non-Volatile Random Access Memory, a type of memory that retains its contents when power is turned
    off.

object deletion The Java Card System version 2.2 and 3 Classic Edition mechanism ensures that any unreferenced
     persistent (transient) object owned by the current context is deleted. The associated memory space is
     recovered for reuse prior to the next card reset.

OS Update OS Update process/mechanism of JCOP.

package A package is a namespace within the Java programming language that may contain classes and
    interfaces. A package defines either a user library, or one or more applet definitions. A package is divided in
    two sets of files: export files (which exclusively contain the public interface information for an entire package
    of classes, for external linking purposes; export files are not used directly in a Java Card virtual machine)
    and CAP files.

shareable interface An interface declaring a collection of methods that an applet accepts to share with other
     applets. These interface methods can be invoked from an applet in a context different from the context of
     the object implementing the methods, thus “traversing” the firewall.

subject An active entity within the TOE that causes information to flow among objects or change the system’s
     status. It usually acts on the behalf of a user. Objects can be active and thus are also subjects of the TOE.

transient object An object whose contents are not preserved across CAD sessions. The contents of these
     objects are cleared at the end of the current CAD session or when a card reset is performed. Writes to the
     fields of a transient object are not affected by transactions.

UpdaterOS OS that implements the OS Update.

user Any application interpretable by the Java Card RE. That also covers the packages. The associated subject(s),
     if applicable, is (are) an object(s) belonging to the javacard.framework.applet class.

11         Acronyms
AID Application Identifier, an ISO-7816 data format used for unique identification of Java Card applications (and
    certain kinds of files in card file systems). The Java Card platform uses the AID data format to identify
    applets and packages. AIDs are administered by the International Standards Organization (ISO), so they
    can be used as unique identifiers.
    AIDs are also used in the security policies (see ’Context’ below): applets’ AIDs are related to the selection
    mechanisms, packages’ AIDs are used in the enforcement of the firewall. Note: although they serve different
    purposes, they share the same name space.

AP Application Provider.

applet The name is given to a Java Card technology-based user application. An applet is the basic piece of code
     that can be selected for execution from outside the card. Each applet on the card is uniquely identified by
     its AID.

APSD Application Provider Security Domain.

ARM Advanced RISC Machine.

CAD Card Acceptance Device, or card reader. The device where the card is inserted, and which is used to
    communicate with the card.

DFA Differential Fault Analysis, a side channel attack that induces faults into cryptographic implementations, to
    reveal their internal states..

DPA Differential Power Analysis is a form of side channel attack in which an attacker studies the power consumption
    of a cryptographic hardware device such as a smart card.

GP GlobalPlatform.

ICV Initial Chaining Vector.

ISD Issuer Security Domain.
